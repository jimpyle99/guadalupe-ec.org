        What comforting words for Juan Diego to hear. And, the Blessed Virgin 
        Mary talked to him in his language, <b>Nahuatl</b>. She called him 
        &quot;Juanito, Juan Dieguito &quot;; &quot;the most humble of my sons&quot;; &quot;my </font>

        son the least&quot;; &quot;my little dear&quot;. He was 57 years old, certainly an old 
        age in a time and place where the male life expectancy was barely 40. 
        Juan worked hard all his life and was an example of humility.<br>

        <big>In 1523, just two years after the Aztec capital of Tenochitlan fell 
        to Hernán Cortés and his Conquistadors, the first Roman Catholic 
        missionaries arrived to begin the religious conquest of Mexico. <br>
        Among their first converts was a man baptized with the Christian name <b>
        Juan Diego</b>. On the chilly morning of December 9, 1531, Juan Diego 
        crossed the barren hill called Tepeyac to attend Mass. He was brought to 
        a sudden halt by a blinding light and the sound of heavenly music. 
        Before him appeared&nbsp; an astounding vision, a beautiful dark-skinned 
        woman who, calling the Indian &quot;my son&quot;, declared herself to be the 
        Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. She told Juan Diego it was her 
        desire to have a church built on Tepeyac hill, and asked him to relay 
        that message to Bishop Juan de Zumarraga. It was no easy task for the 
        humble Indian to be granted an audience with the top prelate, but the 
        persistent Juan Diego was finally admitted. The incredulous Bishop 
        demanded that he be provided with some proof of the unlikely encounter. 
        Confused and fearful, Juan Diego avoided Tepeyac for several days, but 
        on <b>December 12</b>, while rushing to find a priest to attend a 
        seriously ill uncle, he took a short cut across the hill. The Virgin 
        once again appeared and Juan Diego told her of the Bishop's request. The 
        Virgin instructed him to pick roses from the usually barren and desolate 
        hill and deliver them to Zumarraga as the sign. <br>
        Juan Diego gathered up the miraculous blossoms in his mantle and hurried 
        off to complete his mission. Once again before the Bishop, he let the 
        roses spill out before him. To the wonder of all assembled, a perfect 
        image of La Virgen of Guadalupe was revealed emblazoned on Juan Diego's 
        cloak.<br>
        Juan Diego's mantle, carefully preserved in the new Basilica, has been 
        subjected to extensive analysis over the years. Experts have 
        authenticated the fabric as dating to the 16th century, but have been 
        unable to determine the type of pigment from which the image was 
        rendered. It seems doubtful that in the Colonial era in Mexico human 
        hands were capable of creating a portrait of its exquisite nature. It is 
        even doubtful it can be done in Mexico today.&nbsp; Most wonderous of all, 
        after 465 years, the image of the Virgen de Guadalupe remains clearly 
        imprinted on the miraculous cloak without visible signs of 
        deterioration.<br>
        By order of the Bishop, a small church was soon constructed on the site 
        designated by the Virgin. Skeptics are quick to point out the unlikely 
        coincidence of the Virgin's appearance on Tepeyac, the very site of an 
        Aztec temple dedicated to Tonatzin (earth godess, mother of the gods and 
        protectress of humanity) which had been devastated by order of Bishop 
        Zumarraga.<br>
        The original church was replaced by a larger structure built in 1709. 
        The Miracle of Guadalupe was officially recognized by the Vatican in 
        1745. The second sanctuary was declared a Basilica in 1904. A new 
        Basilica, of modern design and enormous capacity, was dedicated in 
        October of 1976. This is found in the northern section of present-day 
        Mexico City.<br>
        In this and other churches dedicated to La Virgen de Guadalupe 
        throughout the nation, millions of the faithful will gather December 12 
        for processions, prayers, songs, dances, and fireworks to honor &quot;La 
        Reina de México&quot; (the Queen of Mexico).<br>
        In essence, the Spanish conquest of 1519-1521 destroyed the core of 
        Aztec religion-the cult of warfare and human sacrifice. The Aztecs were 
        no longer able to feed the sun, yet the universe survived, and 
        Huitzilopochtli was discredited. Aztec religion had lost its focus by 
        1531.<br>
        The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice on a wholesale scale. <br>
        We must remember that the Aztecs offered annually at least 20,000 men, 
        women and children in human sacrifice to their gods. In 1487, just in a 
        single 4 days long ceremony for the dedication of a new temple in 
        Tenochtitlan, some 80,000 captives were killed in human sacrifice.<br>
        <br>
        Why should the Virgin Mary appearing to an Indian in recently conquered 
        Mexico and speaking to him in Nahuatl call herself &quot;of Guadalupe&quot;, a 
        Spanish name? Did she want to be called de Guadalupe because of the 
        statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Estremadura, Spain? Because of Lupita 
        who lived in Nuevo Laredo?&nbsp; In all apparitions of the Blessed Virgin 
        Mary she identified herself as the Virgin Mary and phrases like Mother 
        of God or another of her titles, and was later usually known by the name 
        of the place or region where she appeared (Lourdes, Fatima). So why 
        should Mary, when appearing to an Indian in recently invaded Mexico and 
        speaking in the local language, want to be named with the Spanish name 
        of Guadalupe? Was she talking about the miraculous statue of Our Lady of 
        Guadalupe, that was given by Pope Gregory the Great to the Bishop of 
        Seville, was lost for 600 years and was found in 1326 by a cowherd 
        guided by an apparition of Our Lady? The statue was named Guadalupe for 
        the village located near the place of discovery. The origin of the name 
        Guadalupe has always been a matter of controversy. It is nevertheless 
        believed that the name came about because of the translation from 
        Nahuatl to Spanish of the words used by the Virgin during the apparition 
        to the ailing uncle of Juan Diego. It is believed that Our Lady used the 
        Aztec Nahuatl word of </big></font><big><b>

        Coa meaning serpent, tla being the noun ending which can be interpreted 
        as &quot;the&quot;, while xopeuh means to crush or stamp out. So Our Lady must 
        have called herself the one &quot;who crushes the serpent.&quot; Serpent-god 
        Quetzalcoatl. Certainly, in this case She crushed the serpent, and few 
        years later millions of the natives were converted to Christianity. And 
        the human sacrifices ended.<br>
        It is interesting to note that in Genesis 3:15 (in the Old Testament) it 
        is indicated a woman would step on the serpent's head. <br>
        <br>
        After the miracle of Guadalupe, Juan Diego moved to a room attached to 
        the chapel that housed the sacred image, after having given his business 
        and property to his uncle; and he spent the rest of his life propagating 
        the account of the apparitions to his countrymen. He died on May 30, 
        1548, at the age of 74. Juan Diego said to the Blessed Virgin Mary: &quot;I 
        am a nobody, I am a small rope, a tiny ladder, the tail end, a leaf&quot; as 
        a model of humility for all of us. <br>
        <br>
        In July of 2002 Juan Diego was canonized (declared a Saint) in the 
        Basicila of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City. <br>
        The well known prayer Ave Maria has its roots in Luke I:42 where 
        Elizabeth (who is Mary's cousin) salutes Mary and in Luke I:28 where the 
        Arch Angel Gabriel salutes Mary. <br>
