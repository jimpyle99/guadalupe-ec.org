  <h3><strong>Orientation  Guide for Medical Volunteers
  </strong></h3>
  <p>updated 2016 by 
    Kate Landy MD, adapted from 2004 guide by  Beena Kamath MD<br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Welcome  to the Orientation Guide for our Clinic</strong></p>
  <p>This information is based on the  experiences of medical volunteers working here in Guadalupe.  The Clinic is an amazing place to work, where  the patients are truly appreciative of your work and time, and come to call you  &ldquo;Doctors Who Cure.&rdquo;  Many leave their  homes in the early morning hours to get in line before our doors open, and wait  for hours for their turn.  It has been a  privilege and responsibility to have this kind of trust from the people here.</p>
  <p>Of course, working in the Clinic is a new  experience for most of us.  The cultural  differences, different concepts of medicine, lack of continuity of care, lack  of a variety of medicines and equipment (as well as support staff) that foreign  doctors are accustomed to, as well as the language barrier, can make treatment  of the patients in this region a challenge.   As the patients come to trust you more and more and see that your type  of medicine works, they will follow up, and then the rewards are fulfilling in  working here.  The patients and their  appreciation of what you do make this job worthwhile.</p>
  <p>We hope that this guide is helpful to you  as you begin your own experiences working here in this very special place.  We have been as honest and complete as we  know how to be, with the bad and the good. </p>
  <p>The clinic is located in the small town of  Guadalupe, in the Zamora-Chinchipe province of southern Ecuador.  Guadalupe is about 45 minutes by road from  the provincial capital of Zamora.  It is  a beautiful area where the Andes are descending down into the Amazon -- there  are mountains all around, covered with green trees and jungle-like  vegetation.  There are beautifully  colored birds and butterflies everywhere, and the clouds hang low over the  mountains in the mornings.  The weather  is often warm and humid during the day (more jungle-like than the dry Sierra  climate), with cooler temperatures at night, and it often rains for at least a  little while every day or two.  People  are very polite and friendly.  It is a  lovely place, well worth visiting.</p>
  <p><strong>The  Patients</strong></p>
  <p>The patients can range in age from newborn  to old age, though most of the children you see will be for acute care  visits.  Most well child care is done  through the Ecuadorian public health system, where patients can also receive  vaccines (which are not carried in our clinic).</p>
  <p>The patients range from very poor to the  middle class, from living in the countryside as farmers to living in the  city.  Most of the patients work in  agriculture, using their machetes, planting, and harvesting.  Patients may also have other jobs, including  secretaries, teachers, drivers, construction workers, miners.  They have a range of economic wealth, some  being unable to afford even the simplest treatments, to others, who travel from  the bigger cities like Loja and are able to pay for many tests, consults and  medicines. </p>
  <p>There are three main cultural groups:  the Saraguro, the mestizo, and the  Shuar.  They tend to intermarry within  their own indigenous groups, thus are relatively culturally homogenous.  The Saraguro men usually have long braided  hair, with black short pants, and easy to distinguish black felt hats.  The women wear many layers of skirts,  including a top pleated skirt, the anako, paired with a colorful blouse, and  elaborate beaded jewelry.  The Shuar have  a typical facial appearance with high cheekbones.  Both groups use traditional medicine, things  such as &ldquo;uña del gato&rdquo;, or &ldquo;sangre de dragon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;horchatas&rdquo; or &ldquo;aguas del  monte&rdquo; to cure illness before seeking modern medicine.</p>
  <p>There are some important cultural  distinctions that can make treating these patients interesting.  First of all, there is a great reliance upon  traditional medicines and natural remedies.   As a general rule, patients try natural remedies before entering your  consultorio.  Secondly, their  representation of illness is often more dramatic and the symptoms are different  than what you may be used to.  Rely on  your clinical judgment in these cases, as often, their history and exam do not  mesh well.  The Shuar also have a  reputation of putting blame on those that help them, looking for a reason that  an illness was caused (there is much prejudice against them for this very  reason). </p>
  <p><strong>Patient  Knowledge</strong></p>
  <p>Low health literacy is a common issue.  Patients may have chronic illnesses, but have  often have little understanding of what those are, and be unable to describe  the condition.  In addition, they may  have had surgeries, and be unable to tell you exactly why.  They may have been treated with medicine, and  be unable to tell you what medicine, and why they were taking it.  </p>
  <p>This is one of the greatest challenges in  terms of providing appropriate health care.   Doing a reliable and credible Past Medical History, Past Surgical  History and Current Medication List can be nearly impossible in some  cases.  Some patients will say that they  had &ldquo;tumors&rdquo; but were unable to say in which organ, and why the tumor was  removed, or if it was cancerous.  It is  extremely difficult to get medical records or lab / pathology reports from  elsewhere, unless the patient brings them in him or herself.  Other doctors probably have not taken the  time to explain illnesses and medications to patients, so taking the time to  make your health education as thorough and understandable as possible is a  great service to the patients, and a useful way to spend your time.  It also engenders trust in you as a caring  doctor.</p>
  <p>Many patients also come to Guadalupe for a  second opinion.  It is good practice to  ask if they have seen other doctors before about the condition that they are  describing to you, as many times they have already had numerous tests done and  a diagnosis given.  They may not disclose  any of this to you unless you ask.   Sometimes they have been told they need surgery (as in cases of  symptomatic gallstones, or uterine fibroids causing menorrhagia and chronic  blood loss anemia), but they are afraid of surgery and want to know if you have  some foreign medicine to help them.   Sometimes the patient is sick and was seen the day before by their own  specialist with prescriptions already given, but they come to ask your opinion.  Sometimes people bring in lab and imaging  reports, which is always very helpful.   Many times they don&rsquo;t bring in anything for you.  Just do the best you can for that day, and it  is OK to ask them to come back with their health records at another time.</p>
  <p><strong>Triage</strong></p>
  <p>Mainly, the order in which you see patients  is in the order in which they arrive.  It  is hard to place judgments on the order to see the patients when certain have  traveled extremely far to arrive to see you.   Typically patients who are very ill with acute medical problems do not  come to the mission clinic to be seen.   Occasionally a nurse may alert you to a sick patient who needs to be  seen expeditiously, but this is unusual.  </p>
  <p>In the past, when the Ecuadorian public  health system essentially excluded the poor, doctors at the clinic would have  to limit the number of patients seen to 30-40 per day.  However, in the past several years the  government has made great improvements to its health system to make care much  more inclusive.  Patients using the  public health system (including the health dispensary or &ldquo;Subcentro de Salud&rdquo;  across the river in the town of Guadalupe) can receive their care for  free.  As a result, the demand for care  in the mission clinic has diminished.   The average patient load is about 10-15 patients per day, but can be as  few as 3 and as many as 25 or so.  Some  patients come primarily to see the dentist, and will buy a &ldquo;consulta&rdquo; with you  while they are there, to discuss whatever is bothering them.  Sometimes there are lacerations to suture  (every family owns and uses at least one machete), but for an actual emergency  to come in is quite rare.  </p>
  <p><strong>Medicines</strong></p>
  <p>The Clinic has an nice pharmacy, with a  good variety of medications.  There are  antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, oral antidiabetic medications,  antihypertensive, and lipid lowering, among others.  There is currently a government ban on  importing any medication, so we are not able to use donated medicines as we  have been in the past.  However, there is  still a general belief that we have foreign medicine that is different from  what is generally available in Ecuador, and patients will travel to see us in  hopes of finding something new and different.</p>
  <p>Challenges that we have faced regarding the  prescribing of medicines includes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Incorrect use of medicine:  In any store or local pharmacy, a patient can  walk in and buy medicine without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.  Thus a patient will often self-treat with  medication or natural remedies before arriving to the Clinic.  Most commonly, people will buy one Ampicillin  (Ampibex) tablet for a headache or skin infection, or a Naprosyn (Apronax) for  pain or infection.   </li>
    <li>Desire for Injections:  Many patients want injections.  There is a belief that injections work faster  and stronger than other medicines, even though they are more expensive and last  for a shorter time.  In addition,  patients think that one injection will cure an illness.  Sometimes they will say that other doctors  have only prescribed pills for their ailment, as if oral medications are  nothing.  Many Ecuadorian doctors treat  musculoskeletal pain with B vitamin injections, which seem to have a placebo  effect.   Another example is IM  Diclofenac for musculoskeletal pain -- I had a patient who was kicked by a  horse, received one diclofenac injection when seen by the doctor, and was not  prescribed any pain medication in pill form to take home.  The most dangerous example are the patients  who desire IV calcium for their bone pains, which can cause cardiac  arrhythmias.  You will frequently be  called upon to do some education about why oral medications are often better  treatment, last longer, and are in the patient&rsquo;s best interest as they can have  something to take for their arthritis pain at home when it flares up (for  example).  We do have DepoMedrol and lidocaine  for intra-articular injections when you feel it is appropriate to do so in  clinic.</li>
    <li>Misunderstanding of Chronic  Treatments:  Because of this desire for a  &ldquo;quick fix,&rdquo; an injection that will quickly cure their illness, it is helpful  to educate patients regarding chronic illness, for example, high blood pressure  and diabetes -- illnesses that are monitored on a chronic basis and not  treatable with a quick ten day course of medicine.  There is a common perception that high  cholesterol can be treated with a month of medication as a cure.  Patients need to understand that they have a  chronic illness, and when you want to see them back.</li>
    <li>Vitamins:  The patients are very concerned regarding  vitamin deficiencies, although it is rare to see a clear cut case of vitamin  deficiency.  Many patients who feel  tired, or have bone pain, or stomach discomfort, want vitamins to help them  feel better.  I have often tried to  explain that while multivitamins are unlikely to hurt them, what they feel is  not due to a lack of vitamins -- and supplements are unlikely to be a  panacea.  On the other hand, many poor  patients have difficulty affording food and are probably not eating a balanced  diet, so a multivitamin may not be a bad thing.   I have sometimes prescribed B vitamins to newly recovering alcoholics,  and calcium to postmenopausal women.  Use  your clinical judgment about when they are warranted, and when they are just  another unnecessary expense.</li>
    <li>Stopping Treatments Early:  Because of their desire for a quick fix, some  patients are unsatisfied if the medicines do not work right away.  They are impatient to take a full course of  medicine for 7 to 10 days, and will often take the treatment for a day or so  before visiting another doctor, who will most likely change your treatment.  For this reason, I try to reinforce the  duration of treatment, and why it is important to complete the treatment, and  if the treatment does not work well, make sure you tell them to come back.  If they know that you want to see them again,  they may return instead of going to someone else.  Also, I try to give a clear idea of how many  days they will need to get better, and return precautions, symptoms or  scenarios in which I will worry that the treatment is not working well.  </li>
    <li>The patients often want some  sort of medicine:  This can be a challenge,  because many patients feel that they must leave with something.  It is important to use your clinical judgment  in the context of the situation.  If my  giving a child with a cold a cough syrup prevents them from going to another  doctor for a shot of penicillin, I may prescribe the cough syrup.  It is also important to note that people here  do not have a supply of routine over the counter medicines (such as  acetaminophen) at home, so it is often very reasonable to prescribe something  mild if you feel it is warranted.</li>
    <li>Many patients like  polypharmacy:  Sometimes it is  unavoidable, and you have to give one person four or five medicines, but you  may want to try to stick to a fewer number of medicines to avoid confusion.  If the patient comes in with a complaint for  every organ system (and there are many of these patients!), it is OK focus on  the most bothersome.  Sometimes patients  have traveled far to be seen and I feel bad leaving complaints unaddressed, so  I will err on the side of prescribing relatively benign medications such as  ranitidine and Tylenol.</li>
    <li>The patients share  medicines:   If one person uses a  medicine that helps them, they will share it with their neighbor or husband  whether or not they have discussed it with a doctor first.  Just beware that this occurs. (Of course, it  occurs elsewhere too.)</li>
    <li>The patients do not always buy  the course of medicine as you prescribed.   I have prescribed a 3 month course of iron for anemia, and the patient  bought 4 pills.  Many patients are  limited by their finances.  Also, it is a  very polite culture, and people may not want to say no to your face when they  disagree with your treatment plan.   </li>
    <li>Antibiotic resistance is a bit  of a problem, as it is everywhere.  I  still start with the common first line drugs (Amoxicillin for ear infections,  Bactrim, Amoxicillin or Cephalexin for UTI in kids or Bactrim or Ciprofloxacin  for UTI in adults, for example)  and give  the patient guidelines for returning.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Common  problems</strong></p>
  <p>You will see a variety of common primary  care problems -- colds and coughs, joint pains, dysuria, etc.  However, there are some common issues that,  depending on where you practice, you may not see very often in your current  practice, and you may want to read a bit about before you come:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sun-related eye diseases are  very common here, such as pinguecula and pterygium.  There are also lots of cataracts.</li>
    <li>Because of imperfect water  sanitation and home bathroom facilities, problems like intestinal parasites  (ascaris, giardia, amebiasis) are endemic.   You may want to review their life cycles, manifestations and treatments  -- albendazole and tinidazole are readily available in the clinic  pharmacy.  I find that for adults,  albendazole 400mg x 1 and tinidazole 2g daily x 2 will kill most intestinal  parasites if you want to treat empirically.</li>
    <li>Gastritis is also very common,  and can be due to parasites.  Because of  sometimes poor sanitation, H. pylori is also endemic.  Most people will be H. pylori seropositive,  so if you are clinically suspicious of it, you may just want to treat  empirically.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Writing  Prescriptions</strong></p>
  <p>When you have decided what medicines you  will use, you will write these down in a prescription.  Be aware that the prescription is not merely  something that is given to the pharmacy to translate for the patient -- the  patient keeps the prescription, and it is their user guide.  Medications dispensed by pharmacies are not  labeled with patient instructions, as they are in the US.  The patients need everything written down  very clearly, and will probably ask you for specific times that they can take  the medicine.  I write every detail as  clearly as I can on the prescription, including the indication for the  medicine.  Many patients are elderly,  cannot see, cannot read, and are forgetful.   They will hopefully have someone to help them read your prescription  later, and if you have written everything down completely, it will be a big  help to this third party who did not hear your explanation.</p>
  <p>For example:<br />
    Enalapril 5 mg #30<br />
    Toma una tableta antes  del desayuno diario  (presión)<br />
    Aspirina 100 mg #30<br />
    Toma una tableta antes  del desayuno diario (circulación)</p>
  <p>Instead of putting down specific times, I  tended to say &ldquo;before breakfast&rdquo; for one time per day medicines or &ldquo;before  breakfast and dinner&rdquo; for twice a day medicines, just to make things easier. <br />
    Also, in addition to signing your  prescription, by Ecuadorian law you need to stamp the bottom of your  prescription with a name stamp -- which will be provided to you by the clinic  staff.</p>
  <p>Often times, patients will ask you to write  for medicines for patients that you have not seen.  I have made it my policy to only write  prescriptions for patients that I have actually seen, except for over the  counter medicines.</p>
  <p><strong>The  Clinic Schedule</strong></p>
  <p>The Clinic opens at 8 AM and closes at 5  PM, on Mondays through Fridays.   On a  busy day, you may be working for most of the day, though most days you will be  done by 3pm or so.  On a slow day, you  may work for part of the morning and be free in the afternoon (although you  need to be available by phone in case a patient comes in).  Lunch at the Convent starts at noon, and it  is best to plan your day accordingly to be down at lunch as punctually as  possible, although it is understood that you may be late on occasion, when  dealing with a tough patient, etc. </p>
  <p>If you are a volunteer bringing your family  or non-volunteer spouse to Guadalupe, please be aware that, for various  reasons, the sisters are unable to accommodate larger families and children at  their table.  Please see my separate  document regarding volunteer families for details.</p>
  <p><strong>Dress  Code</strong></p>
  <p>Scrubs are the preferable dress for the  doctors in the Clinic, as it identifies you as a member of the clinic  staff.  There is a supply of scrubs that  you can borrow during your time here, or you may want to bring your own that  fit, and then leave them upon your departure to increase our supply!</p>
  <p><strong>Work-life  balance</strong></p>
  <p>Working in the Clinic is rewarding, but it  can be tiring.  In the medical field,  there is always a balance to be had between service and self-preservation.  A burned out doctor is not good for anyone,  so if you are feeling overwhelmed, please let the clinic manager know.   However, with the current patient numbers,  the workload is usually quite manageable.</p>
  <p>Occasionally patients may knock on your  door after hours to ask for a consulta or for some medicine.  There is no retail pharmacy in town (aside  from the mission clinic pharmacy and the public health center), so on weekends  people may ask you for some kind of medication.   Some people perceive that you have your own little private pharmacy in  your home.  Even if you do have a private  stash (of allergy medication or something), I would not recommend giving it out  and encouraging this practice.  It is OK  to ask patients to wait until the clinic is open.  In an actual emergency, please do your best  to help out -- after all, you are the doctor in town.  (The Ecuadorian doctor at the public health  center lives 45 minutes away in Zamora.)</p>
  <p><strong>Perception  of Foreign Doctors</strong></p>
  <p>Some people will prefer your care to that  of an Ecuadorian doctor for the sheer fact that you are a foreigner.  Many patients think that because you come  from elsewhere, you brought &ldquo;good medicine&rdquo; with you.  Other patients will think that because you do  not use vitamin shots or natural medicine, you cannot help them.  Because of the doctor shopping that often  occurs, you may have one chance to make a difference to a patient.   If you really communicate well your  treatments despite the language barrier, and take the time to show that you  care about their well-being, they will come back, as long as they do not live  too far away.  If you give them the  opportunity to know that you want them to follow up to provide continuity of  care, they will.  Give them a time frame  for when they will get better, and when to come back if they are not. </p>
  <p><strong>Other  Doctors</strong></p>
  <p>Across the hanging bridge that leads from  the Mission to the town of Guadalupe, there is a Subcentro of health, staffed  by an Ecuadorian doctor (Dr. Alan).   There have been mostly friendly and cooperative relations between the  staff at the Subcentro and our Clinic.   Their clinic has its own pharmacy, though sometimes they do run low on  medication.  They also offer vaccines for  children and adults that are not available at the mission clinic.  Dr. Alan has a good reputation.  During my time here there was a concern about  a rabies exposure, and Dr. Alan proactively contacted the family and started  rabies prophylaxis treatment.  The  mission clinic staff mostly works in parallel with the public health clinic,  but there is a lot of crossover with patients using both clinics.  The Subcentro is generally staffed by 1-2  doctors, at least 1 nurse, and a dentist.   They dispense medications for free to patients.  The Subcentro is also able to provide  contraception for patients, which is not available at the Mission clinic  (though I have felt free to discuss methods and make suggestions to patients).</p>
  <p><strong>Lab  Tests</strong></p>
  <p>Many patients love lab tests!  Some will screen themselves for different  diseases, and can go to a privately owned lab, where the lab owner is only too  happy to mark up a lab sheet charging the patient for a CBC, lipid panel, BUN,  Cr, SGOT, SGPT, C-reactive protein, ASO, Rheumatoid factor.  The patient may then bring these tests to  you, without them having been   interpreted by a physician before.   It is an opportunity for you to explain to them where their health is  good, and where it could use some improvement.</p>
  <p>There is no lab at the clinic, nor xray or  ultrasound machine.  We are able to do  the following point of care tests, at the following out of pocket cost to the  patient:</p>
  <p>Fingerstick blood glucose      $1<br />
    Spun hematocrit                     $1<br />
    Urine dipstick                         $1<br />
    Urine pregnancy test              $2<br />
    You can do your own wet mount free of  charge.  </p>
  <p>Otherwise, if you feel it&rsquo;s important to  get lab tests, you can give a patient a piece of paper with the lab tests that  you want written on it, and they can go to a private lab to get it done.  They pay for the tests, have them drawn, and and  need to return to the lab another day to retrieve the results themselves and  bring them back to you.  Often it does  not happen, either because of expense, or because the process is too cumbersome  and the patient has other priorities.   So, your diagnostic options are VERY limited.  It is disconcerting, but a really interesting  intellectual exercise to rely solely on your clinical experience when treating  people, based on probabilities and the rule of &ldquo;first do no harm.&rdquo;  Since I am unable to do appropriate follow up  on high risk medications, I often err on the side of prescribing the medicine  that I think is most likely to help, and the least likely to do harm.</p>
  <p>A few words about diabetes -- often  patients with diabetes will come to the clinic for a check-up and a glucose  check without having taken their medication in the morning.  Although it gives them reinforcement that  they need their medication, it does not give you a good sense of how well  controlled their diabetes is on their medication.  Patients do not have any way of checking  their blood glucose at home, and Hemoglobin A1C testing is not readily  available.  When managing diabetes in  this setting, you often feel like the blind leading the blind.  All I can really do is base my treatment plan  off of today&rsquo;s blood sugar, and whether they are having any symptomatic  lows.  It is not ideal, but it&rsquo;s better  than nothing -- and patients appreciate the time you spend with them,  explaining the importance of good dietary choices and exercise.</p>
  <p><strong>Your  Consultorio and Resources</strong></p>
  <p>There is one general medical examining room  in the Clinic, two rooms for the dentists, an operating room (used during  surgical campaigns), a room for storage, a room for sterilization, and a room  with a bed.  We do have supplemental  oxygen if needed in an emergency, and there is a small supply of emergency  medications though not a full ACLS/PALS crash cart.  There is a microscope to view wet preps.  The main medical examining room has an  examining table, with stirrups to do pelvic exams.  In addition, there is an adult regular blood  pressure cuff, and an ophthalmoscope/otoscope unit attached the wall.  A private bathroom is attached. </p>
  <p>There is also a computer in the main  consultorio, with a simple EMR that is basically a list of prior SOAP  notes.  It is helpful to see whether the  patient has been seen in clinic in the past, and if so what has been done  before.  There is no running problem  list, medication list, allergy list, etc -- so you need to collect pertinent  information as you go.  Since we have  physician volunteers from multiple different countries, it is helpful if you  can do as much of your charting as you can in Spanish.  There is also a computerized list of  medications from the pharmacy, how much of each medication is available, and  how much it costs.</p>
  <p>The computer in the consultorio has  internet, and we are working on getting wifi in the consultorio as well.  It is great to be able to access online  resources such as UpToDate to help you with clinical questions (you do need to  have your own UpToDate account, as the clinic does not maintain one).  There is a small library of medical books,  some of which are 10+ years old -- but texts like dermatology and ophthalmology  atlases and tropical medicine books are always helpful, even when older.</p>
  <p><strong>Patient  Finances</strong></p>
  <p>The patients come from a variety of  economic backgrounds.  Our Clinic offers  inexpensive medical care.  Still, there  are some patients who may have a hard time affording what we offer.</p>
  <p>Every patient must come with $2 for the  initial ficha, the number in the line to see you.  We do not change or lower this price for  anyone.  We practice the philosophy that  everyone must contribute something to keep the clinic going, for their dignity,  and plus in order to value the service that we provide. </p>
  <p>It is good practice to communicate with  patients about their finances, and whether they can afford the medicine that  you are prescribing.  There are times  when it may be best to shorten a course of treatment, or have patients buy  their medicine in smaller increments to that they can afford it.  Sometimes you need to be creative to increase  your chances of successful treatment.</p>
  <p><strong>Vital  Signs </strong></p>
  <p>For the most part physicians need to do  their own vital signs.  This is generally  do-able since the patient load is not overwhelming.  I have been doing whatever vital signs I feel  are warranted.  For sick children, I  think it is reasonable to get a temperature, pulse and respiratory rate.  For older patients, I think documenting a  blood pressure and doing a quick cardiorespiratory exam (with at least a  gestalt for pulse and respiratory rate) is usually warranted, with a  documentation of those vitals if they are abnormal.  You will need to decide what vitals you think  will be useful and high-yield for each individual patient, so that you can use  your time wisely.</p>
  <p><strong>Perception  of Illness</strong></p>
  <p>Because of the language and cultural  barrier, it is even more important to take the time with the patients so that  they understand your treatments.  They  will then be more likely to follow them.   For that reason, try to be as complete as possible in my explanations of  the disease, whether it is curable or the symptoms can be expected to occur,  when they should follow up, and exactly how they need to take the  medicine.  The more that you can explain  to the patients, the more likely they will succeed in following your treatment  plan and following up.</p>
  <p>There is a sometimes inaccurate concept  that people have regarding illness, that everything can be cured.  The most common example is arthritis.  Many people do hard manual labor for most of  their lives, and have worn out joints.   They have never been told that arthritis does not have a cure, only  medicine to treat and calm the pain -- or they have been told, but do not want  to believe it.  When they understand that  a medicine exists to help them, and they can return when they finish the  medicine that you have given, they are more likely to come back, instead of  thinking that you have failed.</p>
  <p><strong>Follow-Up  and Feedback</strong></p>
  <p>This environment can be tough in  encouraging follow-up for a multitude of reasons.  It may be costly and time consuming for a  patient to follow-up -- if a patient has to travel for 4 or 6 hours to get  here, they will not return often.  Many  times patients will go to their local doctors to have sutures removed, or will  remove them themselves.  This also occurs  with chronic illnesses such as hypertension:   when the patient&rsquo;s hypertensive headache is relieved by your medicine,  he/she may not come back, if he does not understand that once he stops taking  the medicine, his headache will return.</p>
  <p>Oftentimes, the feedback part of patient  care is lacking.  Most of us in medicine  like to see our patients after they have (or have not) been helped by our  treatments, but in the cases where our patients are better by our treatments  here, they will not come back.  Also,  sometimes a patient that has not gotten better with a treatment may switch to  another doctor and not give you another chance to make them better.  Stress that you want the patient to return if  they are not feeling better, and they just might.</p>
  <p><strong>Transport  of Care</strong></p>
  <p>Currently the emergency medical system in  Ecuador is centralized, and you (or your nurse) dial 911 for an ambulance.  The call goes to a dispatcher in Quito, you  explain to them what the problem is, and if they agree that the patient needs  to be transported they transfer to call to Loja.  Loja then contacts the hospital in Zamora,  which sends the ambulance.  This has been  a relatively rare occurrence, but historically it has taken about 45 minutes  for the ambulance to arrive after making the call.  Some ambulances are well-equipped and staffed  by well-trained EMS personnel, and others are very basic without much life  support capability.</p>
  <p>If patients need to go by bus, they are  subject to bus schedules and bumpy roads.   Taxis are prohibitively expensive for most families.  Zamora is about 45 minutes away by bus.  Loja is 2-3 hours away by bus, and has larger  hospitals with greater capability.</p>
  <p><strong>Living  at the Mission</strong></p>
  <p>Living and working in Guadalupe is a unique  experience all its own.  You are living  at a Catholic Mission with an international flavor, with volunteers from the  US, Europe, and Latin America.  We speak  Spanish, English and German.  People from  a variety of religions faiths volunteer and work at the Mission.</p>
  <p>Many volunteers eat meals with the nuns,  the Sisters of Teresita.  Getting to know  the sisters is one of the great side benefits of working in Guadalupe.  They have a wonderful sense of humor, and are  very caring.  People are very  appreciative of the work that you do, and becoming a part of this wonderful  family is a great experience.  It is  certainly not a requirement to attend Mass, though you are always welcome.  There is very little separation here between  secular life and religious life, and people in the community do appreciate  seeing you at Mass from time to time.   Religious festivals here are fun and colorful, and it is interesting to  take part in them.</p>
  <p>When dining with the sisters, please keep  in mind that you are a guest in their house -- and use basic politeness and  manners that would befit a guest in someone's home.  They are likely more conservative than you  are in their dress, and they appreciate it if you cover your shoulders and your  legs down to your knees when you are dining with them, as a courtesy to your  hostesses.  Thank you for understanding!</p>
  <p><strong>Volunteer  Residence</strong></p>
  <p>There is a residence for single volunteers  or couples behind the clinic.  In  addition, there is an apartment building just across the hanging bridge in town  where families or couples may stay.  They  have kitchens equipped with the basics, private bathrooms, and a washing  machine for clothes (which you then hang dry).   There is wifi in the residences.   Compared to how most people live in Guadalupe, it is quite  luxurious!  The power and water  occasionally do go out, but they are mostly reliable.  </p>
  <p>There is cell phone service in Guadalupe,  and the cell company that works well here is called Claro.  You can buy a Claro sim card for your phone,  which will give you service here, and will give you an Ecuadorian cell phone  number while you are using the Claro card.</p>
  <p><strong>Climate</strong></p>
  <p>This region is a transition zone between  the Sierra and the Amazon -- where the Andes are descending into the Amazon  basin. The weather here is often quite warm and humid during the day, and the  sun is very strong.  Even when the air  temperature is not that hot, it will feel hot if you are standing in the sun.  It often rains at least a little bit every  day or two, which does cool things off quite a bit -- and the rain can come in  unpredictably.  It does cool off really  pleasantly at night.  It is good to bring  a variety of clothing to be prepared.  If  you plan to travel to higher altitudes like Quito or Cuenca, the weather can  get pretty cold there -- so bring layers.   There are also biting insects that may take advantage of bare skin, and  I tend to wear lightweight long pants and sleeves when I go out, to protect  myself from the sun and the bugs.  From a  cultural standpoint, it is OK to wear shorts and tank tops in town.</p>
  <p>Because of the high humidity, some kinds of  clothing (like jeans) do not dry quickly.   Especially during the rainy season, when there is less direct sun,  things may take a long time to dry -- and may actually start to grow mold on  them before they dry.  So try to bring  mostly technical, quick-dry clothing.  </p>
  <p><strong>Good  luck as you prepare for your adventure!</strong>  It is a special place, and almost all  volunteers leave with smiles on their faces.   Many come back again and again.   We hope you will join us as a part of this great big international  extended family.</p>

  <p><strong><u>A  Guide for Volunteers Bringing Families and Children</u></strong> <br />
    Kate Landy MD<br />
    2016</p>
  <p>Taking a family sabbatical and having a big  new adventure as a family has so many rewards.   Guadalupe is a great place to bring your family for short or long  periods of time.  Some volunteers have  brought spouses and children down for a month during the summer, and others  (like us) have made it their home for a year.   As parents considering this kind of experience, there are some things  that you want to know about life in Guadalupe.   I will try to give some practical information here.</p>
  <p>So that you have some perspective of who we  are -- we are a family of four from the United States.  I am a family physician volunteering in the  clinic for the better part of one year.   My husband is a social worker by training, and has mainly been volunteering  teaching English in schools and to the community (a pastime that he fell into  not by design, but by popular demand).   We have two children -- a 10 year old son and a 7 year old  daughter.  We are blond and blue eyed,  and generally stick out like sore thumbs.   My husband&rsquo;s Spanish was &ldquo;muy poquito&rdquo; when we arrived in Ecuador, and  our children had basically no Spanish background.  We live in a mid-sized city in the Pacific  Northwest, so living in a small town on the Equator is a big change for us.</p>
  <p>Getting to the point where you can leave  your home for an extended period of time is actually the hardest part -- it is  not easy to shore up your life such that it will not implode while you are  away.  I found Elisa Bernick&rsquo;s book <u>The  Family Sabbatical Handbook</u> to be a helpful practical guide about how to get  it all done.</p>
  <p><strong>Visas</strong></p>
  <p>At the time that I am writing this guide,  you do not need to get a visa if you are coming from the US or Europe and you  plan to stay in Ecuador for less than 90 days -- you automatically get a  tourist visa stamped into your passport at the airport.  If you plan to stay longer, you will need to  apply for a missionary visa.  Volunteers  and first degree relatives qualify, and with the missionary visa you can stay  in Ecuador for up to a year or more.  </p>
  <p>It was frustrating for me that I was unable  to find good information about what documents we would need to get our  visas.  What we ended up needing was our  passports, and the children&rsquo;s original birth certificates with Apostilles and  official Spanish translations (of both the document and the Apostille), plus  $20 per visa.  These requirements can  change quickly and without notice, and I was happy that I erred on the side of  being over-prepared rather than under-prepared.   We had to go through the Conferencia Episcopal Ecuatoriana, which is the  main office of the Catholic Church in Quito -- they work with the embassy and  the Ecuadorian Ministry of the Exterior to help you obtain the visa.  The mission staff should be able to help you  with the process for obtaining the visas -- you will need to be in Quito  (probably for several days) in person to get them done.</p>
  <p><strong>Housing</strong></p>
  <p>The mission provides a nice apartment in  town, just across the hanging bridge from them mission.  It is a small building with 3 units -- one  for nurse Amanda, one for a volunteer couple, and one for a family with  children.  The family apartment has 2  bedrooms, a kitchen, a living / sitting room, a dining area, and 2 bathrooms  with hot showers.  One bedroom has two  twin beds pushed together for the adult couple, and the other bedroom has bunk  beds with an additional trundle bed underneath (sleeps 3 comfortably).  The kitchen has a full sized refrigerator, a  gas stove / oven, a microwave, two large stainless steel sinks, and quite a bit  of usable counter space.  There is a  small balcony that looks toward the river and the mission.  There is also a washing machine on the 3rd  floor of the building, with space to hang dry your clothes.  There are screens on many of the windows, so  you can get some fresh air at night when the temperature is nice and cool.  </p>
  <p><strong>Food</strong></p>
  <p>It is important to know that while adults  are welcome to eat lunch and dinner with the sisters, children generally are  not .  The sisters only have limited  space and energy, and having children at the table can be stressful for them  (and sometimes for the family)..  So  please expect to eat mainly at home.  The  mission has given volunteer families a food subsidy to help cost the cover of  food.  We have spent about $400-500 per  month on food for our family of four, without eating out much or being very  extravagant -- and the mission covers about half of that.  This is helpful to know for budgeting  purposes.</p>
  <p>There is a lunch break from 12-1pm at the  clinic, and you can go home to each lunch with your family.  Depending on your circumstances, you may  decide to hire a local woman to come and cook lunch for you and your family,  and do some cleaning and child care if you so desire -- the clinic staff know  the local people well and can help you arrange this with someone  trustworthy.  As a reference point, we  have paid about $30 per week for someone to cook us a hot lunch and keep the  apartment clean, and apparently we are paying pretty generously.</p>
  <p>You can get a lot of basic food items in  town -- milk, fruit / veggies, pasta, rice / grains, eggs, cooking oil, some seasonings  and spices, chicken, beef (though tends to be stringy).  For other items that are harder to find, you  may have to go to a larger supermarket called Tia in Yanzatza or Zamora, each  of which is about 45 minutes away by bus.   There you can get somewhat healthier cereal (most of what you can get in  smaller stores is sugar cereal), yogurt, butter (instead of margarine),  granola, whole grain bread, cheese, crackers, etc.  </p>
  <p><strong>Money</strong></p>
  <p>Finances are different for everyone, but it  helpful to know more or less how things work here.  Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar and has an  almost entirely cash economy -- very few places accept credit or debit cards  (besides larger hotels, airlines, etc).   Ironically, many places don&rsquo;t have change for larger bills such as  $20&rsquo;s, especially if you are buying something small.  </p>
  <p>There is no bank or ATM in Guadalupe.  There are ATMs in Yanzatza and Zamora, and we  have been able to use our home debit cards to withdraw cash from our US  checking account most the time.   Occasionally an ATM may not be working, but generally we have been able  to find one that does work.  We generally  need to go to either Yanzatza or Zamora to do grocery shopping once a week  anyway, so we tend to withdraw cash while we are there.  It has not been necessary for us to open an  Ecuadorian bank account.  </p>
  <p><strong>Schools</strong></p>
  <p>As parents, our children&rsquo;s education is  paramount.  Of course, there is no one  right way to approach your children&rsquo;s educational experience -- but it is  helpful to know what the options are.  As  the principal of our children&rsquo;s school put it, any academic deficit that they  have when the return will be totally insignificant and overshadowed by what  they will have learned in their year abroad.   Here in Guadalupe there are three elementary schools to choose from, and  they are all in close walking distance to the Mission.  All of them are tuition-free public  schools.  (When reading this, please  realize that circumstances can change quickly and without much notice, so all I  can tell you is what is true today.)</p>
  <p>First is the large public school called Pio  Jaramillo (elementary) and Daniel Martinez Ordoñez (the only middle and high  school in town).  This is where most of  the kids go, particularly the Mestizo kids.   It has more of a traditional classroom structure, with one grade level  and one teacher per class.  The classes  tend to be somewhat large, and I have heard from a few sources that teachers  sometimes have trouble maintaining discipline (but not dangerously so).  It may be difficult for teachers to give an  individual child extra attention in this setting.  I think the major up side of this school is  that children have a larger pool of children their age from which to draw  friends.  The school also sometimes puts  together a soccer team that competes against kids from other towns on occasion  -- so if your child is a soccer enthusiast, that could be a draw as well.</p>
  <p>The next option is the mission school,  which is quite small (about 20-25 kids) and serves mainly Shuar families.  The woman who runs the school is a good  friend of Amanda&rsquo;s and is very nice, and would undoubtedly look out for your  kids.  On a cultural note, the Shuar have  historically been more of a fierce hunting and gathering society, with families  mostly traveling around on their own rather than living communally -- so I  understand there is not as much of a sense of community unity among the  Shuar.  Because it is such a small  school, children from multiple grade levels will be in the same class room.</p>
  <p>The third option is another small school  (also about 20-25 kids) called Inti Pakari, which serves mainly Saraguro  families.  It is a bilingual school, with  class conducted mainly in Spanish, but also with regular lessons in the  traditional indigenous Kichwa (Quechua) language.  There are two classrooms, with a teacher in  each room --  one for the younger  children and one for the older kids -- with mixed grade levels in each  room.  The Saraguro have traditionally  been more of an agrarian society, with multiple families living together -- and  so my understanding is that they tend to have more of a strong sense of  community than the Shuar.  Inti Pakari  has an active parent group that takes an interest in the school.  </p>
  <p>Of course, the final option is  homeschooling -- or doing some kind of hybrid between the two.  We decided to bring our children&rsquo;s math books  from their school in the states, so they could keep up with what their  classmates at home were learning.  (They  do 2 pages of their math books per day, in addition to whatever homework they  have from their local school.)  There is  wifi in the residence, so you can use online resources as well (more on  electronic gadgets below).  Our feeling  was that going to a physical school would be important for our kids, both to  learn Spanish, and to make friends and feel like the had a community of their  own.  We ended up choosing Inti Pakari,  as it felt like a close community with an interest in cross-cultural exchange.</p>
  <p>Of note, any of these schools is likely to  feel more chaotic and less focused that what your child is used to.  There is also more of a focus on memorization  and copying passages out of a book, rather than teaching critical  thinking.  This is true in many  developing countries.</p>
  <p>In order to register your child for school,  you will need to go to the school district office in Zamora before school  starts.  We needed our passports, and a  copy of the kids&rsquo; report cards (ideally with some kind of explanation of  educational standards) from the previous year.   To save yourself some headaches, you may want to have it translated into  Spanish.</p>
  <p>A word about grade levels -- they are  numbered differently in Ecuador.   Children enter school when they are 4 years old, which is considered  &ldquo;the first year of basic education,&rdquo; or first grade.  Kindergarten is then numbered as &ldquo;second  year,&rdquo; or second grade.  For this reason,  both you and the school district may be confused about what grade your child  should be in -- that is why it is helpful to have something in writing about  what standards your child has already achieved.  </p>
  <p>Ecuadorian kids wear school uniforms,  generally a white shirt (t-shirt or button down shirt/blouse), dark navy blue  or black pants or skirt, white socks, and black shoes.  You can buy uniforms in town pre-made if they  have your child&rsquo;s size, or you can have uniforms made here in town to fit your  child more precisely.  Shoes are  generally of pretty bad quality, so you may want to bring some black  shoes/sneakers from home for your child to wear to school.  The school system also gives out grey  sweatsuits to kids, and it is OK to wear those as well.</p>
  <p>Of note, Ecuadorian kids do not eat lunch  at school, as the school system does not have the facilities or resources to  feed children.  You can send a midday  snack with them, but they come home to eat lunch.  School here runs from about 7:30am to  12:30-1pm.  Here in this part of Ecuador  the school year runs approximately from early September through the end of  June.</p>
  <p><strong>Friends</strong></p>
  <p>It is not easy for kids to leave home and  start over someplace new, and they will doubtlessly be worried about whether or  not they fill find any friends.  We have  found people in Guadalupe to be very open and welcoming, particularly the  children.  Foreign kids are particularly  interesting, and the local children will probably be drawn to them automatically.   Since Guadalupe is such a small town (it is  about 7 blocks long by 3 blocks wide), we have felt pretty comfortable giving  the kids a much wider berth of independence than they would have at home.  The kids play spontaneously in the street,  and can&rsquo;t really go far.   Our son is a  soccer enthusiast, which has helped him tremendously in making new friends  among the school age boys -- kids often play pickup games of soccer of  basketball at the &ldquo;cancha,&rdquo; or covered play area (sort of like a concrete  sports field) in the middle of town.   There is also a small river where people swim, often on hot afternoons  and during the weekends.  The river  running right through town is contaminated by an upstream mine, but about a  half mile walk from town is a cleaner river that is swimmable.  The current is a bit strong for our younger  child so we don&rsquo;t let her go there without us, but our son is a strong swimmer  and we allow him to go there with his friends.   (As a note of reference, we barely let our kids play in the front yard  alone at home.)  </p>
  <p>With regard to the language barrier, the  kids here in Guadalupe have been quite patient and willing to figure out what  we are trying to say.  I do think there  is a gender difference between how boys and girls socialize that can make  things a little challenging.  Boys tend  to bond over a shared activity, such as sports or swimming the river together  -- and they don&rsquo;t really have to talk about it.   Girls tend to bond over the conversation that happens around the shared  activity -- they tend to be much more verbal than boys in their  relationships.  For that reason, I think  at first it may be more challenging for girls to make close friends than for  boys.  That is merely my observation, and  certainly may not be true for all children.</p>
  <p><strong>Gadgets</strong></p>
  <p>Of all the electronic gadgets that you have  at home, you may be wondering what is useful to bring, and what would even work  down here?  Depending on how &ldquo;unplugged&rdquo;  you want to be, you may or may not want to bring much down.  From experience, I will say that living in a  foreign country is an intense experience from which everyone may want to  &ldquo;escape&rdquo; sometimes.  It may not be a bad  idea to bring some kind of movie player (DVDs are the most reliable), a device  to play music, and certainly some kind of computer with which to communicate  with family and friends back home.  You  may want to keep a family blog of your experiences so that others can follow  along with what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
  <p>There is wifi in the residence.  The speed of the wifi can vary tremendously  and unpredictably -- from pretty darn good, to practically nonexistent.  It seems to be a little slower in the  evenings.  Most of the time it is good,  to the extent that you can stream videos from Netflix or YouTube -- but not  reliably so.  If you are planning  homeschooling that requires a lot of online work, it is good to be aware of  that.</p>
  <p>Laptop computers and tablets generally work  well.  We bought Kindle e-readers for our  children, so that we could avoid the problem of having enough English language  books to keep them occupied -- and that has worked out wonderfully.  Our kids have been so excited about their  Kindles that they have actually read a lot more here than they did with &ldquo;real&rdquo;  books at home, and there is an endless supply of books (as long as the budget  holds out).</p>
  <p>Cell phones can be interesting.  The Ecuadorian cellular company whose service  works best down here is called Claro, so when you arrive in Ecuador you can buy  a Claro sim card to put into your phone.   This will give you a new Ecuadorean phone number, so be aware of  that.  You will need to make sure that  your phone is &ldquo;unlocked,&rdquo; as some phones are actually proprietary to your cell  carrier company.  I have an iPhone with  3G service, and while I could get Claro cell service just fine in larger towns,  it wouldn&rsquo;t work in Guadalupe.  I went to  the Claro office in Zamora to ask why, and was told that my 3G phone was too  fancy for the Guadalupe network, which was only 2G.  I then bought a cheaper phone that gets  service in Guadalupe.  Go figure.</p>
  <p>Skype or Face Time works somewhat well,  depending on the speed of the internet signal at the time you are making the  call.  Sometimes it works great, other  times it keeps slowing down or freezing, and you catch about half of what the  person on the other end is saying.   Still, it is a lot better than nothing!   WhatsApp is a free app that lets you call or text people over wifi  internationally for free, and that works great as well -- though the person you  are communicating with also needs to install WhatsApp on their phone for it to  work.</p>
  <p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
  <p>What is there to do down here?  A reasonable question.  For sure, you will be getting used to a much  slower pace of life than what you surely have as a working family back home.  Aside from trips to the corner store to get  various food items, there are no errands to be run.  You will not be shuttling your children back  and forth from school or activities, and you will not be attending to the  seemingly endless list of home improvement projects.  After the millions of things that you have to  get done in order to leave for a period of time, it is a welcome relief.  On the other hand, the slow pace of life is  both the best and the most challenging part of acclimating to life in  Guadalupe.  </p>
  <p>To a large extent, this is a  make-your-own-fun kind of place.  As  noted above, the kids play in town or go to the river.  Adults also play soccer and a variation on  volleyball called Ecua-volley.  There are  several decent swimming pools where you can swim for a few dollars within a  30-40 minute driving radius, including El Arenal in Cumbaratza (on the way to  Zamora, with a fun water slide!), El Castillo Real (also on the way to Zamora),  and Tierra Dorada in Yanzatza.</p>
  <p>There are a couple of tiny restaurants in  town, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be open very reliably.  We have ordered takeout food in advance at  times.  There is a frog and tilapia farm  in Piuntza, the next town over, that will sell you fresh fish or frog meat  (have a culinary adventure!).  My husband  and I often go out for walks in the evening as the sun is going down, when the  temperature is cooler.  My daughter and I  have been taking beadwork lessons from a local artisan who makes really  beautiful beaded jewelry (Amanda can help you find someone to teach you, if you  are interested).</p>
  <p>My kids have really enjoyed interacting  with the animals.  Amanda, who lives  upstairs from us, has an incubator in her apartment and raises chickens and  quail.  She also has a docile old female  horse who is gentle with children.  At  the mission there are chickens, geese, guinea fowl, rabbits, cows and  pigs.  Since we are city folk, this is a  fun new experience for us!  </p>
  <p><strong>Health  Concerns</strong></p>
  <p>Definitely go to a travel clinic before you  leave -- you will all probably need yellow fever and typhoid vaccines, plus  whatever else you may be lacking with the usual vaccines (Hepatitis A,  etc).  There aren&rsquo;t really mosquitoes  here, and you do not need malaria prophylaxis or mosquito nets here in Guadalupe,  but it is recommended if you are visiting the coast.  You might give some consideration to rabies  prophylaxis vaccines -- rabies does exist here, although the vaccine seems to  be pretty readily available if there were an exposure.</p>
  <p>Although there aren&rsquo;t many mosquitoes,  there are certainly other biting insects that cause very itchy bites.  Bring along hydrocortisone cream as  apparently it doesn&rsquo;t really exist here.   The sun is super strong and it is not easy to find good sunblock, so I  suggest investing in sunblock from home (and maybe insect repellant).  Bring long sleeves, long pants, sun hats,  mainly technical clothing that dries fast in the high humidity here.  (You can also bring short sleeves and shorts,  but you want to have the option of covering up for sure.)  </p>
  <p>There are venomous snakes around,  especially hiding in high grasses.  Some  of the bad snakes are pretty tiny (a little bigger than a pencil) and hide  really well.  We try to stay out of brush  and tall grass as much as possible.  </p>
  <p>Intestinal parasites are endemic here.  We drink bottled water whenever possible,  though tap water is fine for bathing, washing dishes and cooking (if you are  boiling it).  Salads are high risk, and  we avoid eating uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit unless we have soaked  them in bleach water ourselves.  Still,  we have had to take parasite meds from time to time!</p>
  <p><strong>Spanish  Language Learning</strong></p>
  <p>There are many ways to go about learning  Spanish, if you don&rsquo;t already know it.   You can start lessons before you come, or use an app like Duolingo to  get a head start.  There are also many  Spanish language schools in Ecuador, many of which are happy to teach children  as well.  We ended up spending a month in  Quito going to Spanish school in the mornings before we arrived in  Guadalupe.  If you plan to go this route,  be aware that the accent on the coast is apparently very different than that  from the rest of Ecuador, to the point where people in Quito say they have  difficulty understanding people from the coast.   The Quito accent is quite pure and easy to understand, and is similar to  that in Guadalupe -- so keep that in mind if you deciding on a location for  Spanish school.</p>
  <p>There are teachers and other locals in town  who would be happy to earn some extra money tutoring in Spanish, but they are  unlikely to speak English.</p>
  <p><strong>Safety  Standards</strong></p>
  <p>In the USA safety is paramount, and you  will immediately notice that it is NOT paramount in Ecuador.  Drivers do not care about pedestrians.  No one uses car seats or booster seats, and  you are lucky if you have a taxi with seat belts.  The hanging footbridge in town is sometimes  missing planks.  People ride motorcycles  without helmets, with infants or toddlers, and with machetes in their hands.  Sometimes it is kind of funny, like looking  at one of those pictures in a kids&rsquo; puzzle book where you have to figure out  how many things in the picture are wrong.   There is a certain amount of inherent risk in life, and a little more  when you are living in a developing country.   Chances are that everything will be fine -- after all, we all survived  our helmet-free childhoods.  Just be  aware that you will have no choice but to ease up on some of your safety  standards.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>If you are considering a family experience,  please do consider Guadalupe.  It has  been a wonderful experience having more family togetherness time, and watching  our children learn Spanish and blossom in their new found confidence.  Getting back to basics, and getting used to  having a lot less &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; around is a great thing.  Guadalupe is a very family-friendly place,  and the kids really love the degree of freedom that they have here -- freedom  that we just would not feel comfortable giving them at home.  I can see the kids becoming more giving and  thoughtful before my eyes.  We are all  learning a lot, about what makes us tick, what we can live without, and what we  can&rsquo;t.  I feel sure that our experience  this year will pay dividends for years to come.</p>
