		<p class="erfahrung">We had the opportunity to be medical volunteers at the Mission  Clinic in December, 2001. At that time we had no laboratory or radiology  support but a small pharmacy with most classes of drugs represented. The clinic  was well organized with the Receptionist greeting patients, setting up charts  and determining the order in which patient&rsquo;s were seen. This same individual  dispensed medications from the adjoining pharmacy.<br />
			There were 3 examining rooms. Two rooms were adequately furnished,  with an examining table, desk, chairs and basic equipment. An  electrocardiograph machine was available with readable tracings if one used  some imagination. Dental rooms were being built and a surgical suite being  furnished.<br />
			The patients were exceedingly polite and appreciative of the care  rendered. Although depression, musculoskeletal problems and parasitic  infestations were common, all manner of pediatric and adult illnesses were  seen. Surprisingly, malaria, tuberculosis, and major injuries were rarely, if  ever, seen. Although people were poor and for some growth and intellectual  development were stunted, overt malnutrition was rare. For those who could  afford it, laboratory, radiology and specialty care were 2 hours away.<br />
			The accommodations at the Mission were very comfortable with  private rooms with showers and communal meals. We were treated as honored  guests. The Parish Priest, Nuns and workers could not have possibly made our  visit more pleasant. In the evenings, we visited the surrounding villages and  were fortunate to participate in a local religious and secular festival.<br />
			Although working with limited diagnostic and ancillatory support  leads to misgivings about quality of care issues, I believe the opportunity to  serve as volunteers in this setting was rewarding both for the health care  provider and for the greater Community.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung">We were at the Mission  Clinic for one week in December 2001 when it opened. There is a local physician  Dr. Jaime Ortiz who has been hired to attend once per week. There have been a  stream of foreign dentists and last week 4 physicians from a city 3 hours away.  The clinic has examining rooms, 2 dental rooms complete with dental x-ray, a  surgical suite including a scrub room and recovery, and a pharmacy. The  surgical area is not yet functional. Although the pharmacy has limitations we  were able to treat most of what we saw. The clinic may soon have a basic  laboratory. There is x-ray, laboratory, and surgical services in a city (Loja)  2 hours away for the few who can afford it and when the road is passable.<br />
The people were indiginous subsistance farmers with a few  shopkeepers and miners. The gold mines are about one hour away. The oil  companies are not in this particular region. There is malaria in the general  area but little in the immediate vacinity. Similarly we did not see dengue or  yellow fever. Mosquitos were present but not in great numbers. The water is not  clean and that coupled with often the people sharing accomodations with their  animals, giardia and worms were endemic. We saw some acute diarrhea and perhaps  one person with typhoid fever. Many people had back pain (called kidney  problems!) as well as depression, alcoholism, hypertension, and children with  chronic ruptured tympanic membranes. We also saw all manner of other medical  illness from dysfunctional vaginal bleeding to rheumatoid arthritis to parkinsonism  to kidney stones. Some access to birth control is available in the city.  Remarkably some people of greater means came from the city to this jungle  clinic for second opinion, records in hand. Surgical supplies were present for  suturing, draining, packing and casting, but analgesics and local anesthetics  were deficient. Hopefully this has been rectified. The examining rooms are  equipt but you may wish to bring a portable ophthalmoscope/otoscope as a backup  as well as a glucometer, gloves, gel, and hemoccult cards.<br />
The parish is clean and accommodations quite comfortable with our  own rooms and hot shower. The Nuns supplied us with preboiled water to drink  and hearty meals safe to eat. We even felt comfortable eating the salads served  to us by them, usually not a good idea in this setting. The Padre is from  Austria. He has done remarkable things for his people in a place where the  church does the social service tasks that are usually the purvue of the  government. The government gives vaccinations sporatically and thus far this is  not being performed by the clinic but perhaps in the future. The village is in  the high tropical jungle along the main trade route to the amazon in Ecuador.  It is poor but beautiful. I suggest that you be up to date for dT, polio,  hepatitis a+b, and obtain yellow fever vaccine. You will need malaria  prophyllaxis. I suggest a book Handbook of Medicine in Developing Countries by  Catherine Wolf M.D. and Dennis Palmer D.O. Although mainly geared to the  hospital it has usefull information in table format.<br />
The weather is most pleasant. It is about 75*F during the day,  sometimes warmer, and 65*F at night, again sometimes warmer. It rains every  day. I brought scrubs and a laboratory coat to work in and was most comfortable  and felt adequately attired. One has to be wary of crime in Quito or Guayaquil  but I felt perfectly safe in Guadalupe, especially as a guest of the parish  mission. The currency is the US dollar. It goes far in Ecuador. There is little  to spend it on in the village. We did not have a chance to be tourists but the  beauty of the surroundings and the reward of helping others who appreciated the  effort more than made up for it. They could use an operating microscope. If you  know of any institution who might be able to donate one that would be terrific.  That way ENT and basic Ophthalmology could be performed. Many children have  ruptured TM's and many adults have cataracts and pterygeums.</p>

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="EXPERIENCE2002" id="EXPERIENCE2002"></a>EXPERIENCE 2002</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">Today I saw a 43 year old woman, six months pregnant, afraid of  her alcoholic husband who beats her. The next patient was her husband... A 4  year old girl presents with a draining fistula from her tibia with  osteomyelitis and possible osteosarcoma. She does not cry. Her father cannot  afford to take her to an orthopedist. At an average of 20 years complaint per  person with vaginal discharge, all told, today I saw 200 years of vaginal  discharge.<br />
	<br />
	I  believe that here, unfortunately, family planning begins at menopause. Large  families are common despite the poverty. This is because of lack of resources,  fear of child mortality and tremendous peer pressure to marry young, often to  separate from parents and in order to leave home. Depression is common. Being  poor, working in the fields, gold mines, and jungle with little help for those  unable to care for themselves (at any age) and with many mouths to feed with  little food, does not lend to merriment.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Yet  people are appreciative and enduring, with a strength and at times grace that  we would be unable to muster in less harsh circumstance. There is music, dance,  and religious festivals. And all is not without humor: &ldquo;Doctor, I have terrible  headaches in the sun.&rdquo; ...&quot;What make it better?&quot; ... &ldquo;I wear my sombrero.&rdquo;  ... &quot;Then I suggest that you wear your sombrero&quot;... Many complain  that their bones hurt when it is cold. However, we are in the Amazon! Yet many  individuals have multiple problems that impact their quality of life and  ability to work and subsist.<br />
	<br />
	Even  though the medicine we practice may give us pause in terms of quality, the  peasants have such tremendous problems, and so few places to turn for help,  that our worst efforts become models of exceptional care. And the clinic that  Padre has built could be placed in the middle of any city in the United States  and not seem out of place. The people line up by the dozens to be seen. It is  10 o&rsquo;clock at night and they are already showing up to be seen tomorrow. We  just finished our day&rsquo;s work. I will need to rest in order to have the energy  and spirit to try to do, in my own way, GOD&rsquo;s work&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="erfahrung">I had the good opportunity to return to Guadalupe Ecuador for one  week in October 2003. I brought a nurse practitioner student with me, Ms.&nbsp;Stephanie Motter. Between us  we saw about twenty patients each day. This was my third visit to the mission  and clinic. That we were less busy than on previous occasions reflects the  maturity of the health care facility. With almost continuous medical coverage  there is less of a pent up and almost desperate need to be seen, allowing for a  more comprehensive approach to care. In addition the small laboratory can  perform blood counts with differential, urinalyses, skin scrapings, pregnancy  tests, and vaginal smears. PAP smears can be sent to the local cancer hospital  several hours away. Some access to commercial laboratory and radiology is now  available within a couple of hours bus ride. The pharmacy is remarkably  complete for such a remote facility. The full time nurse,&nbsp;Amanda Anderson, is  knowledgeable of the local health care needs and resources. The reputation of  the clinic draws patients from rural and urban locations hours away.&nbsp;<br />
	The pueblos are noticeably more prosperous. For many people cement  walls have replaced porous wooden slats. In part this represents a largely  successful attempt by the government to uplift the life of it's citizenry  through a subsidy program for construction. The struggle for sustenance remains  the dominant theme of life, punctuated by song, dance, sport, and religious  festivals. There is greater ability to educate about health issues. Although  the quality of care remains limited by the resources available in this venue,  it is greatly improved compared to the early days of the clinic.&nbsp;<br />
	The sound, sight and smell, and even feel of the jungle engulfs  you. The rich fusion of European and Indian culture is enticing. Hopefully all  of this will remain as development very slowly encroaches upon an agrarian  society. Words cannot describe what it is like at dawn and dusk to sit on the  verandah of the volunteer's dormitory and just listen to the sounds of the  tropics. Poverty cannot be idealized. The people have a harsh life. They  persevere against great odds in order to survive and raise their families. As a  volunteer, even for a short stay, there is the satisfaction of making a  difference for a few people by providing modern medical care. Each time that I  visit I receive back much more than I give. I plan to return to Guadalupe next  year.</p>

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="Volunteerism" id="Volunteerism"></a>International&nbsp;Volunteerism</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">	I&nbsp;am an internist in private practice in  Madison Connecticut. I have&nbsp;an academic appointment at Yale  University,&nbsp;bringing both medical students and&nbsp;graduate  nursing&nbsp;students into the office. My wife Jana Siman is an APRN. We work  as a team. It is difficult to volunteer when in a small practice. I helped to  run a venue for the Special Olympics when they were in New Haven in 1995, as  well as volunteering at the Primary Care Clinic at the Hospital of St. Raphael  as a preceptor when I first opened&nbsp;my practice&nbsp;in 1983. Jana donated  services to the poor visiting clinics in the Middle East and Brazil during a  previous&nbsp;international business career. Over the years I was disappointed  to find that as a&nbsp;primary&nbsp; care physician&nbsp;most international and  even domestic venues wished you to attend for many weeks, months or even years  at a time. This was impossible. In 2001 I was in the midst of arranging to  volunteer in the Carribean. I met a patient in the office on a saturday  afternoon. His father, Frank Glowski,&nbsp;accompanied him and told me a story  of a former AFS (exchange student) from Austria, Georg Nigsch, who many years  earlier had lived with him for both a year of high school and then seminary  school. He had become a priest at a rural mission in the tropical highlands of Ecuador  along the Peruvian border. He was building a medical clinic. Already an  Ecuadorean doctor, Dr. Jaime Ortiz,&nbsp;had been attending intermittantly. I  decided to get in touch with&nbsp;Padre Jorge Nigsch&nbsp;in the Amazon, or as  they say the Oriente. Sometimes he has telephones, so I sent him an e.mail. We  planned to close the office for two weeks and go. Then came September 11. After  some soul searching my wife and I decided to keep our plans. What better way to  be embassadors for our country during a time of turmoil. Off we went in  December 2001. In Ecuador there are few people with health insurance. In theory  if you are pregnant or a child of five or younger there is universal access to  care. Unfortunately the government clinics are poorly equipped and with few medications.  There are private physicians with variable quality of training, particularly in  rural regions. The doctor often owns the pharmacy with incentive to prescibe,  particularly injectables. In addition the fees charged are often beyond the  reach of the poor peasants, the majority of those in the mountains and jungles.  They use&nbsp;self remedies,&nbsp;shamans, lay midwives, even villagers who  have taken upon themselves the business of suturing wounds, both for cultural  reasons and economic necessity. The population is mainly indigenous peoples,  small farmers, shop owners, and gold miners. Many speak primarily their Indian  language. My wife and I are not Catholic. We knew minimal spanish and less  tropical medicine. With naiveté and misgivings but anticipation we left to join  the team of international medical volunteers at the mission clinic. To our  surprise we were the first volunteers, and the only health care workers within  many kilometers. The nearest hospital was at least one hour away, muddy roads  permitting. We had translaters to help us. The pharmacy was extensive but with  gaps in coverage. The medications were often labelled in german, a  language&nbsp;in which&nbsp;fortunately my wife is fluent. Some of the drugs  were unfamiliar. We broke open boxes and set up examining rooms, set up  charts,&nbsp;and began to see the villagers.&nbsp;By the end of the week we  were seeing about twenty patients daily. The clinic has two fully equipped  dental suites, and operating theater, three examing rooms, a pharmacy,  laboratory, and a fully set up optometry facility. After we returned  home&nbsp;we set about using the internet to recruit doctors, nurse  practitioners, and physician assistants. A German dentist, Dr. Eberhard  Pierro,&nbsp;through a charitable organization began to attract dentists.  Internists, pediatricians, ophthalmologists, and an otolarygnologists have  attended. Dr. Scott Soloway, an ophthalmologist from Branford Connecticut  brought a team to the facility. A dentist from Madison Connecticut, Dr. Alan  Friedler, has worked at the clinic. I applied for a Robert Wood Johnson  International Health&nbsp;Scholarship but was not accepted. Despite this, my  wife has returned, my step daughter Molly Brady has visited twice, and I have  served on another two occasions and will again in december 2004. Individuals,&nbsp;religious  groups,&nbsp;and nongovernmental organizations have donated supplies and  devices ranging from an operating microscope to semiautomated desktop chemistry  analyzers. Thousands of eyeglasses have been donated by the Lions Club,  coordinated by the Madison chapter. Remarkably in almost three years there has  been less than one month without a dentist and less than six weeks without a  primary care health care provider. There have been a few  trainees&nbsp;including a senior Yale APRN student, Stephanie Motter,&nbsp;brought  by me. Washington State University School of Nursing, led by Dr. Lorna  Schumann,&nbsp;has contributed physicians, nurse practitioners and graduate  nursing students to yearly mobile health clinics, traveling&nbsp;to even more  underserved areas, an activity&nbsp;organized by the clinic. The facility is  now averaging about forty patients daily, and when surgeons, dentists, and  primary care physicians are present, up to two hundred, many camping out on the  steps to be certain for a consultation. Among others, REMEDY, an organization  based at Yale that donates recycled surgical supplies, and the American Medical  Resource Foundation in Boston Massachusetts, have contributed supplies.  Medications have been locally purchased in Ecuador and donated from  Europe.&nbsp;They have been&nbsp;given to me by pharmaceutical representatives  who visit my office. I have been able to in turn forward them to South America.  The pharmacy in now remarkably complete. The laboratory can perform a variety  of tests. A technician is soon to arrive from the United States to expand  services and train local personnel. Radiology is available about one hour away,  for those able to pay. The fee for a consultation is one dollar, to see the  dentists&nbsp;the charge&nbsp;is by the tooth. Cataract surgury is fifteen  dollars. Medications are a few pennies to the pill. For this region these are  significant sums, but less that twenty percent of that charged by the local  physicians. For those truly unable to pay, services or produce can be bartered.  But no service is free. It is thought that this gives some ownership to the  health process, and a sense of pride. There is education on sanitation and  other health issues, including&nbsp;AIDS and other sexually transmitted  diseases. And in this Catholic community, the church preaches respect for women  and care of children, but in practical not abstract ways. Parasitic infestation  such as ascariasis, giardiasis, amebiasis and bacterial infectious diarrhea,  are common. At two thousand feet, with few mosquitos,&nbsp;malaria, yellow  fever and dengue rare. Tuberculosis is mainly referred to government  facilities. Common illnesses are seen, such as depression, musculoskeletal  ailments, diabetes, and hypertension. As a practicing internist and adult nurse  practitioner we were actually well prepared for most of what we encountered,  even among children.. Severe surgical emergencies could be sent to the  hospital, minor injuries cared for at the clinic. Vaccinations are given  through the government health center. Thus far the&nbsp;provincial  officials&nbsp;have cooperated, allowing Padre Nigsch to utilize in his medical  building&nbsp;any provider licensed to practice in&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;own  country. If desired, longer term volunteers can obtain malpractice through the  Catholic Medical Missions Board in New York City. Volunteers have come, or are  scheduled to arrive, from the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Austria,  Ireland, England, Scotland, and Canada. Many of these were recruited via the  internet. The Albert Schweitzer Institute at Quinnipiac University is now  exploring ways that college students can both be benefited by the experience  and do creative developmental work for the community. This has been a  remarkable and satisfying journey, but still with long term success uncertain.  Please visit the website www.guadalupe-ec.org and explore the links.

		<p class="erfahrung">In November 2005 I had the privilege of returning to Guadalupe  Ecuador for my fifth visit. I was accompanied by a senior student from the Yale  School of Medicine,&nbsp;Ms. Dara Arons. We flew from Quito to Catamayo.  Then we took a taxi to Loja, where we were met by Pepe. A long time employee of  Padre Jorge, he drove us across the Andes into Zamora-Chinchipe Province and  the jungle road to the mission. The route is now paved much of the way,  shortening the trip to two and one-half hours from the prior customary  four.&nbsp; The pavement turned from concrete and the terrain increasingly  severe but lush. We soon knew that we were approaching the Oriente as clouds  began to drape the mountains.<br />
			The Mission Clinic of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a truly remarkable  oasis of modern medical care in a remote region. There have always been local  physicians of various skills and moral turpitude, private, or fresh from local medical  schools and assigned prior to residency training, to tend to the indigenous  poor.&nbsp; With the providers unaffordable, inaccessible, or ill equipped and  inadequately trained, the populace has turned to shamans and folk remedies, or  self medicated with whatever drugs were available from the local pharmacies.  Lisa Greenfeld, a Peace Corps worker stationed in this area from 1998 through  2000 recently contacted me. She was based mainly in Piuntza. She describes  visiting the various communities and without medical training or experience,  and using a lay book &lsquo;Where There Is No Doctor,&rsquo; she and her husband attempted  to use local remedies to give health care to those otherwise going  &nbsp;without. &nbsp;In addition the province and river valley, under the tutelage  of Padre Jorge Nigsch, was only recently beginning the slow process of  integration of remote villages and ethnic groups into a more cohesive civil as  well as religious unit. A local physician, Dr. Jaime Ortiz would visit the  church mission a few hours once weekly. In this environment Padre Jorge and  Mother Superior Consuelo Carvajal chose to build a new health care facility,  initially to be staffed by foreign volunteers.&nbsp; When I first arrived with  my wife and APRN Jana Siman in 2001, the facility was still being constructed,  provision of regular dental and medical care and surgeries a romantic dream of  an Austrian Priest and Colombian Sister.&nbsp; The dental suites were just  being finished, an operating room bereft of equipment, and a limited  pharmacopoeia of German herbal and mainstream drugs.&nbsp; We stayed in the  Casa de Encuentro, the residence hall of the religious community. The  volunteers&rsquo; residence was a cleared lot above the church grounds.<br />
			&nbsp;Dara and I arrived at the Mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  During our week we saw many patients of all ages with various primary care  ailments. The daily work load ranged from ten to forty two persons for the  medical doctors and about fifteen daily for the German dentists.&nbsp; Many of  those seen now had charts, with documented histories. Some continued to follow  up for their chronic ailments. Frequently, prescribed medications had been  discontinued as personal supplies grew short, but with education and ongoing  affordable access to health care providers, some of the clients are now  continuing their medical regimen. The pharmacy on premise has allowed, with  some creativity, continuous care for chronic ailment, and almost universal  ability to treat acute disease. &nbsp;For the last three years we have begun to  see surgical and other volunteer specialists coming into jungle. I was  fortunate this trip to witness such an event. An&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:\Users\Georg\Documents\E.%20Webseite_Frontpage\CLINIC\STAFF\2002\AguirreCarlos.htm">ophthalmologist from Loja</a>&nbsp;and his team  descended upon and invaded the clinic. Well planned and well executed, more  than ninety people were seen by the surgeons and medical staff. In the  afternoon and well into the night cataract and pterygeum procedures were  performed, giving sight to the blind. At a surgical cost of about ten to  fifteen dollars, not insignificant to these poor people, many were able to be  cared for who otherwise would have needed several hundred dollars for similar  operations.<br />
			Not all was work for us. On slower days we were able to visit a  hamlet and a pueblo. On one such excursion, accompanied by the Sisters, we  participated in a local lesson and mass. Prior to this Dara had the experience  of educating a couple about their child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, alleviating the  guilt that added to the parent&rsquo;s burden.<br />
			The lessons of the religious services are seldom that of saving  souls. Never have I heard talk of fire and fury, but rather that the path to  salvation lay through personal betterment and proper treatment of one&rsquo;s  children and neighbors, always with respect and compassion. This is expressed  in concrete ways, never abstract. It applies equally to farmers, professionals,  and politicians. The form and content of services combines European and Indian  traditions. Fiestas abound, giving color and celebration to a difficult  subsistence existence in a harsh environment. As a Non-Christian I never miss  the opportunity to participate in the cultural life of the village.<br />
			This trip we also learned to make empanadas, as a guest in a  private home. We had an adventuresome meal of tilapia, guinea pig and frog at a  local restaurant.&nbsp; Mostly we ate our largest meal lunchtime with the Padre  and Nuns. Breakfast we made ourselves with breads, fruits and grains supplied  to us. For dinner we joined the priest, prepared food ourselves, or made  outside arrangements.<br />
			Our visit to Guadalupe combined hard work and cultural  emersion.&nbsp; Our week ended far too soon. As we left a new dentist from German  and an Otolaryngologist from Maryland arrived. A family physician from Alaska  was en route. Other doctors from Austria, The United States, and Canada are due  to visit. Many other international healthcare workers have served, are  scheduled, or are being solicited.<br />
			It is gratifying to me to see the continued maturation of the  Mission Clinic of Guadalupe, and its tremendous impact upon the health and  financial status of the Indigenous residents of southern Ecuador.&nbsp;<br />
			I am certain that the unspeakable beauty and serenity of the  region will sustain me for yet another year until I return.<br />

<p class="erfahrung"><img src="images/Epstein_Serle_Yacuambi.jpg" alt="Serle Epstein" width="314" height="235" class="volimageidtag" />From October 6 through 17,  &nbsp;2006,&nbsp;Dr. Joseph Connelly,&nbsp;Dr. Margaret Weiss Rivera, both  Family&nbsp;Physicians, and I, an Internist, were in Ecuador for a Jornada  Medica organized by the Clínica Misional &quot;Nuestra Señora de  Guadalupe.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
	We&nbsp;traveled from Quito to Cuenca, the airport in Catamayo  temporarily closed for renovations.&nbsp;The bus to Zamora suffered a broken  tire rim. The driver was&nbsp;able to change the tire and continue. We  eventually arrived in San Carlos, a small town at about 1300 meters of  altitude.<br />
	We held a clinic in the parish house the next day. The following  morning we went to a gold mining town,&nbsp;Nambija Alto, at  several&nbsp;thousands of meters greater elevation. The last 45 minutes we  trekked up a steep trail with medications on our backs. Carrying a fifty pound  back pack with pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;I had mild problems with the exertion, a  racing heart and shortness of breath. Fortunately I quickly recovered.<br />
	People live in ramshackle homes on the polluted slopes.&nbsp;Later  we learned that 400 people perished there four years ago in a landslide. We saw  patients in the local school.&nbsp; Many of the men&nbsp;suffer&nbsp;from cough  and congestion from the dust&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;when&nbsp;blasting in the  mines.<br />
	The&nbsp;following day we had a poorly attended clinic in another  town, Nambija Bajo. Apparently&nbsp;large mining corporations may move back in.  The&nbsp;families were at a meeting to discuss this. &nbsp;<br />
	After a night in Guadalupe,&nbsp;basking&nbsp;in the relative  luxury&nbsp;of the Mission and Residencia, we traveled to Tutupali, a very  remote Indian town. When the road ended we finished&nbsp;our&nbsp;trip&nbsp;by  mule,&nbsp;initially straight down at a 45* angle on mud and stone. This frightening  but beautiful ride brought us to a rugged small pueblo by a rushing clean  mountain stream. Along the way we passed magnificent vistas, with  trees&nbsp;sprouting&nbsp;purple buds. The pueblo&nbsp;of Tutupali  thrives&nbsp;on an economy based upon horses and mules, and by cultivating  banana, sugar cane, corn, and a variety of cracked wheat. Many of the villagers  spoke Quichua, and little Spanish. The local public health nurse, a middle aged  Saraguro woman, translated for us.<br />
	After a day and one half of seeing patients, we mounted our mules  to climb the mountain.&nbsp;Dr. Weiss Rivera&nbsp;slipped off of&nbsp;her mule,  striking her head on a rock. Using dental antiseptic and&nbsp; available  supplies,&nbsp;we sutured her 8 inch laceration. We immobilized her.  The&nbsp;townsmen built a stretcher and, in turns, eight of the men carried her  the two hours up the steep muddy slope. We were able to arrange an ambulance  for the 9 hour drive to Loja.&nbsp;Dr. Connelly accompanied her. She ultimately  did well.<br />
	For the&nbsp;last three days&nbsp;of the Jornada I was the only  physician. We went to a small village, Esperanza, seeing only a handful of  villagers in the&nbsp;small church on a hill. We&nbsp;then&nbsp;journeyed to a  larger town, Yacuambi, staying for two busy days. All told, we saw in one week  465 medical patients. One day I&nbsp;was to&nbsp;examine&nbsp;90 persons. All  of this was possible with the able assistance of&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:\Users\Georg\Documents\E.%20Webseite_Frontpage\CLINIC\STAFF\2002\AndersonAmy.htm">Amanda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:\Users\Georg\Documents\E.%20Webseite_Frontpage\CLINIC\STAFF\2002\ArmijosClaudia.htm">Claudia</a>, who served as translators, and Karen and  Yolanda, working the pharmacy and doing patient intake. Many patients had  parasites, presumed helicobactor pylori associated peptic ulcer disease, respiratory  problems, musculo-skeletal complaints, depression, chronic vaginitis,  prostatitis, diabetes, and children with failure to thrive. Many&nbsp;infants  had poor nutrition&nbsp;from excess sugar water replacing other lacking dietary  components. We also&nbsp;detected congenital heart disease, various fractures,  hypothyroid goiter, and a missed congenital&nbsp;dislocation&nbsp;of the hip in  a now young teenager.&nbsp;<br />
	<a href="file:///C:\Users\Georg\Documents\E.%20Webseite_Frontpage\CLINIC\STAFF\2002\WolmershaeuserSigrun.htm">Sigrun</a>, the dentist, came with us. She saw truly  advanced caries in young people, pulling more than 120 teeth.<br />
	During our visit to Yacuambi, presidential and provincial  elections were held. Every citizen was required to vote. The ballots were guarded  by armed soldiers. The conservative and leftist candidates garnered the  greatest number of votes, but not a majority.&nbsp;There will soon be a run off  election. Ideology does matter in this country, but how it will affect the  rural regions is yet to be seen. At 6 AM&nbsp;Sunday mass in Yacuambi&nbsp;the  lesson taught was that&nbsp;there is an&nbsp;obligation for the wealthy to  assist the poor. Dr. Weiss Rivera was extolled for making a great sacrifice in  coming to Ecuador from the United States, and for her&nbsp;being willing to risk  grave injury&nbsp;to&nbsp;care for&nbsp;the poor&nbsp;citizens of the Oriente.<br />
	After a brief night's stay back at the Mission, I rejoined the  other doctors in Loja for our trip home, again via the road to Cuenca. Back at  work in the USA,&nbsp;in the office, on house calls, and&nbsp;rounding in the  hospital, I remain fatigued, but energized by the experience. We were at  remote, poor, at times stunningly beautiful locations. My companion physicians,  Amanda, Sigrun,&nbsp;Karen, Claudia, Yolanda, and other personnel, were  wonderful to live and work with. We were in truly remote high and low altitude  venues, and carrying our supplies were able to effectively treat most of what  we encountered. There was clearly danger, but under difficult conditions we  rallied in a crisis, and continued our mission.<br />
	Jornadas Medicas serve to provide medical care&nbsp;to isolated  communities. More importantly&nbsp;this represents&nbsp;out reach  services&nbsp;for the Clinica Misional in Guadalupe, giving continuity to our  efforts. I look forward to returning to Ecuador in another year to again  participate in the remarkable story of&nbsp;Padre Jorge Nigsch&nbsp;and his, and our, clinic.<br />

<p class="erfahrung">I returned to Guadalupe September 29 though October 7. For one  week I worked at the Clinica Misional. Padre Jorge had advertised my coming.  This, and the growing reputation of the health care center, ensured a  significant turnout of patients. Up to 55 were seen in a day, averaging 40  persons. The clinic has an ultrasound for those able to use it, a well equipped  laboratory comprised of a variety of chemistries and quick tests, an  electrocardiograph, a large pharmacy with most classes of medications available,  and almost full dental services. Specialists ranging from Plastic Surgeons to  Gynecologists, Otolaryngologists,&nbsp;and Ophthalmologists, are scheduled to  arrive in the coming months. We have an incomplete&nbsp;but growing network of  local surgeons and specialists to which we can refer. I saw the usual variety  of parasitic infestations, rashes, musculoskeletal problems, depression,  metabolic syndrome, occasional asthma and other maladies.&nbsp;Also presenting  de novo were&nbsp;probable uteran and testicular cancer, and congenital heart  disease.<br />
	The problems of the health center are a function of its success.  We needed to turn away several individuals each day in order to give adequate  care to the rest. Amidst the poor and underserved, at least a dozen of whom had  never before visited a physician, were the middle class and well to do from  Zamora and Loja. I would treat a poor farmer for worms, an abandonned single  mother for depression, and then give a second opinion to a young woman being  treated in Cuenca for Lupus Erythromatosis. It is difficult to do a means test  for those who come, so all are seen.<br />
	Despite this, the humanitarian mission remains strong. While I was  attending at the main facility, the&nbsp;other doctors, along with nurse  practitioners and dentists,&nbsp;were on a Jornada Medica to remote villages  reachable solely by canoe. Although there may be issues of continuity of care,  illnesses were identified, health education promoted, and some treatment given,  to the hundreds of children identified by local church and government  organizations. For a brief time&nbsp;these isolated Indiginous people&nbsp;came  to know that they were not forgotten. The conditions of  travel&nbsp;were&nbsp;difficult, the surroundings rustic, but the  volunteers&nbsp;were&nbsp;welcomed as graciously as possible.<br />
	The region is beautiful&nbsp;but poor. One can swim in a clean  mountain stream or hike in the jungle. There remain some wildlife. A tiger  like&nbsp;large cat&nbsp;was hunted for food. It was&nbsp;brought to us to  appreciate.<br />
	I had the good fortune of eating a meal of frog cerviche prepared  personally by the mayor of Guadalupe, Dr. Alan Fuentes..<br />
	I traveled twice to small barrios, one Mistizo, another Shuar, and  attended mass in a small town up the Yacuambi river. Attending&nbsp;church  service&nbsp;is as much a cultural as religious experience. The homilie gives  practical lessons in coexistence and good public and private  governance.&nbsp;As we turn to each other to wish peace, la paz,&nbsp;we  descend from our vaulted place as guest foreign  physicians&nbsp;and&nbsp;replace this&nbsp;with an awareness&nbsp;of comradery  and&nbsp;commonality.<br />
	One need not belong to any religion to&nbsp;appreciate  the&nbsp;mystery&nbsp;and responsibilty that accompanies practicing our  profession.&nbsp;This is an&nbsp;essential part of who we&nbsp;are as doctors,  from ancient times prior to&nbsp;the rites of Eskalipeus and the  Greeks.&nbsp;Each volunteer&nbsp;takes home from Guadalupe and the Clinical  Misional as much as&nbsp;they give.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="erfahrung">Once again I found myself in the Orient of southern Ecuador, amid  the rain, greenery and mustiness of the jungle. Many of the indigenous people  cannot afford their traditional clothes, but more have motorcycles rather than  horses, and concrete homes rather than the ubiquitous leaky wooden shacks. The  rainforest faces defoliation, and families now cook with gas rather than  firewood. The muddy and oft landslide closed automobile road is slowly being  paved but the raw mountain paths remain unchanged. The new government has  promised expanded health care services for the populace, but each Centro de  Salud remains inadequately staffed and poorly supplied.&nbsp; They do provide  significant peri-natal and infant care, including for acquired immunodeficiency  disease, and family planning, and tuberculosis screening and treatment. For  general medical and surgical care there are few doctors affordable to the  impoverished classes. During turbulent times some individuals have stridently  asserted traditional tribal land rights, often at the expense of their  neighbors. The transitional government leadership has not yet effectively  asserted power.&nbsp; Jobs remain scarce, dangerous, and poorly paid, and  subsistence farmers are paid pennies for their harvest as imported foods and  supplies rise in price. Many of the young men leave their families for the  cities or to work as migrants abroad. To compete, new coffee and banana  cooperatives have been formed. Most people still till small plots of land,  mainly for plantains, yucca, and sugar, occasionally for cocoa. Other fruits  and vegetables remain uncommon. A few chickens, guinea pigs, and livestock  share the household. Men blast and haul stones for the gold mines. A few people  have small businesses in the larger towns. There are entrepreneurs who have  opened wireless telephone booths, sell jewelry to volunteers, run restaurants,  and have other profitable ventures. Life pulsates to the rhythm of the  religious calendar, centered on the parish, directed by the priest, and with  catechists and nuns as ambassadors. Against this backdrop we have the Clinica  Misional Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe. The longer term volunteers have left a  mark. Charts are more complete, and care better organized. The clinic functions  efficiently. Although fewer people may be seen when dentists and surgeons are  absent, when they are present a chaotic mass of humanity presents at dawn  impatiently waiting for portals to open. The seemingly reduced patient census  is deceptive. A mobile health fair to surrounding cantons, from villages to  small cities, drew long lines. During two weeks more than 750 people were  examined, and multiple medicines prescribed, each for the same one dollar fee.  The unmet needs of the poor were amply demonstrated. In one city replete with  local physicians, no one would see the house bound elderly, the crippled, or  the dying, leaving it up to us as visiting professionals to provide a modicum  of home care. The purpose of the clinic is as an accessible and affordable  venue to care for the acutely and chronically ill, provide medications, promote  healthy lifestyle, bring surgical specialty services, and give second opinion  when requested. Outreach programs extend practice to the needy in urban areas  or to remote underserved regions.&nbsp; The facility has helped to spur  economic development, and add to the parochial mission of unifying the  community. As an eight year old institution it is imperfect. Each passing year  the maturation of the Clinica Misional is palpable. Much of this is owed to  Amanda Anderson, the full time nurse and clinic administrator, to Padre Jorge  Nigsch, to the full time Ecuadorian support staff, and to the hundreds of  volunteers who have found a temporary calling as humanitarians. We each gain  personal insight and grow as professionals. We share a unique comradeship. For  these reasons I plan to return next year.</p>

<p class="erfahrung">I returned to Ecuador to  work the last two weeks of November, 2009. My short&nbsp;stay was  an&nbsp;extraordinary experience.&nbsp;At that time I overlapped with an ENT  surgeon who arrived&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;me and left&nbsp;just after me,  completing a month long visit. Between seeing &quot;medical&quot; patients and  screening, and usually treating, the hordes of people coming thinking (often  wrongly) that they needed an operation,&nbsp;I&nbsp;attended to&nbsp;about 40  patients a day. Dr.&nbsp; Burger Zapf performed 150 surgeries ranging from  tonsillectomies to parotid tumors to cholesteatomas, and of course many ear and  nasal reconstructions.&nbsp; He was assisted by a rotating group of German  anesthesiologists, and Johannes, a nephew of Padre Jorge Nigsch,&nbsp;who  served as an able&nbsp;surgical assistant. Select&nbsp;patients recuperated  overnight at the facility. Amanda Anderson, the full time nurse, slept in the  clinic.&nbsp;She&nbsp;used her skill and compassion&nbsp;to complement&nbsp;the  family members&nbsp;caring for&nbsp;their relative recovering from a procedure.  It was efficient, and as safe as possible for a rural&nbsp;venue. We also had  coincident full dental services, and the usual selling of pharmaceuticals at a  discount, and the fitting of donated eyeglasses. It was a remarkable, but at  this facility not uncommon, occurrence.&nbsp;Each year witnesses improvements  at the Clinica Misional. We now have electronic medical records, and a back up  generator. We have a portable dental care unit. Since its inauguration in  November 2001 through the beginning of&nbsp;2009 it has witnesses  about&nbsp;60,000 patient visits. This does not count those seen by&nbsp;health  fairs organized&nbsp;in surrounding communities.&nbsp; When surgeons and  specialists arrive, people&nbsp;travel from many hours away, even the coast,  for consultation and treatment. We are open to all who come, but remain true to  our mission to primarily provide affordable&nbsp;healthcare for&nbsp;the poor.  For the&nbsp;four months following my visit&nbsp;we will have a primary care  and tropical disease specialist physician from Costa Rica, and a cardiologist  from North Carolina. The&nbsp;heart specialist&nbsp;will be able to perform  cardiac ultrasound when necessary with the machine on site. The laboratory has  not been&nbsp;optimally maintained nor utilized. I have charged the current  doctors to&nbsp;restore it to&nbsp;as it was last year. Tests&nbsp;need to  be&nbsp;used judiciously,&nbsp;but available when necessary. As usual the  accommodations were clean and spacious. I stayed at a volunteer apartment in  the town, although often sharing the companionship of the other volunteers  there and at the residence on the mission grounds. The evenings and weekends  were punctuated by the song, dance, processions, lectures, and services that in  the guise of municipal or religious fiestas or displays of fealty mark the  passage of time and season in&nbsp;the cloud forest. Most meals were shared  with the Sisters and Padre. Some we prepared as a group. We&nbsp;went to a  local restaurant for&nbsp;a frog and tilapia feast, with rice, salad, and  yucca, to celebrate the leaving of one of the anesthesiologists. Even the Madre  Superior attended! The sights, sounds and smell of the jungle, and the clouds  rising to summits of the Andes, highlighted our mornings and evenings. Local  and national politics&nbsp; were at times the grist of discussion, as both  politicians and church figures came to observe the developments in&nbsp;town  and talk of change. Drawn in by idealism and sustained by a sense of purpose, I  continue to come back.<br />

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="EXPERIENCE2010" id="EXPERIENCE2010"></a>EXPERIENCE 2010</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">I had the opportunity to serve at the Clinica  Misional Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe the last two weeks of November. The first  week I overlapped with an otolaryngology surgical team from Germany and the  United States. Also during my time I worked with German dentists and  anesthesiologists, an Austrian physician, and Swiss dental hygeinists. Each  member of our medical crew had different volunteer experience. For some this  was the first time abroad, for others one of many. We had new practitioners  just completing training, active private professionals, and those recently  retired. The clinic was busy during surgical days, and quiet at the end when  the specialists had left. I did a two day Jornada Medica to rural villages in a  remote valley. It was advertised immediately before we arrived and we had about  75 medical and 20 dental patients, but with extensive dental preventive care  teaching in the local schools. With our free time at the end of the week we  returned there to climb the mountains, explore a cavern, and swim at the base  of the waterfalls. The government has made great strides in improving access to  care, now open to all ages and both genders at the Centro de Salud in each  town. Prenatal and early child care, vaccinations, birth control, tuberculosis  and HIV treatment are handled by them. There is some access to basic dentistry  and chronic medical management. As usual the care is rendered mainly by asigned  young physicians and public health nurses, although in Guadalupe we are blessed  with a long term health care provider, Dr. Alan Fuentes. Resources, though more  plentiful than under previous administrations, remain limited and uncertain.  The Clinica Misional is in general better equipped and able to offer specialty  services unavailable otherwise. It is anchored by well trained primary care  physicians, and coordinated by Padre Jorge Nigsch and Amy Anderson, R.N. Our  pharmacy remains well stocked by local standards but with increasing difficulty  with both purchasing drugs locally and bringing in material donations from  abroad. The laboratory is in temporary disarray, and the ultrasound machine  needs repair, but with plans for maintanance and improvement as community needs  are assessed. We have a new generator to ensure uninterrupted surgery and  support the electronic medical record. This enhanced charting allows for rapid  recall of previous visits, legible documentation, access to the pharmacy  formulary, ability to perform rapid internet searches, and the capacity over  the long run to better analyze our accumulated data as to who we are seeing and  how we are treating them. The system is evolving, just recently allowing the  scanning if of diagrams, and not yet expanded to dentistry. The affilated  dental organization in Germany has been supportive in the past, but at times  has not coordinated the calendar well with the local administration, so that  this month we had no dental technician and too many hygeinists. In the future  this will be better controlled from Ecuador and the relationship with this  charitable organization is evolving and uncertain. Despite this I attended to  about 230 patients in my brief stay. We saw the usual assortment of general  medical illness and parasitic infestation. The trend continues for better  understanding of chronic illness, as many people presented for management of  hypertension and diabetes. As I left a doctor arrived from the United States  with his wife and young children to remain for the ensuing three months. A  family physician, he has had previous experience in Africa. His son and  daughter will attend the local schools. I had the opportunity to share with him  some of my insights, as have each doctor before me to those who followed. The  web site remains invaluble in this process. I am proud of each of the  volunteers who take the time to come here and contribute their expertise and  caring. I remain confident in the future of the Clinica Misional Nuestra Señora  de Guadalupe, and it's role in the growth and maturity of this culturally rich  great nation.</p>

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="Experience2011" id="Experience2011"></a>Experience 2011</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">	I returned to Ecuador the end of November  through the middle of December 2011. I was accompanied by a medical student  Jordan Sloshower from Canada by way of Yale University School of  Medicine.&nbsp;<br />
	Student Dr. Sloshower did an excellent job. We  worked collaboratively in the Clinica Misional Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe and  more independently, but utilizing me as a resource, on the Jornada Medica  mobile health fair. At the main facility he introduced himself to each patient,  performed the interview in Spanish, did the appropriate examination, and  developed a plan. Each patient was in turn presented to me, usually in the  room. Jordan established the plan with input from me as appropriate. He was  then responsible for implementing the plan as well as providing targeted  patient education.<br />
	Outside the medical setting he was interactive  with the other volunteers from Germany and Austria. He participated in various  community events, particularly those surrounding both a religious and a secular  festival that overlapped our visit. He befriended people in the  community.&nbsp; As is true of all of us he brought his own perspectives and  preconceived notions with him to Amazonia, but was able to adapt to working at  a secular and professionally run rural clinic that happened to be based at a  religious center in an overwhelmingly Catholic community. Having previously  completed studies in International Health he saw the conflict between theory  and practice, particularly in a country with so much change occurring in social  structure and governance. He began to understand the pitfalls that occur when  central planning and distant bureaucracy are in conflict with the immediate  needs of the populace.<br />
	Along the way I hope that his innate kindness,  cultural sensitivity and sense of responsibility were fostered in this setting.<br />
	This is one example of how the clinic gives back  to us while we serve.<br />
	The last couple of years there have seen many  changes but much remains the same. The government has established a Subcentro  de Salud in the larger villages. Each center gives vaccinations, treats  tuberculosis and Leishmania infections, gives perinatal antiretroviral  treatment for pregnant women infected with HIV, provides family planning, and  is a venue for child and maternal care. Under President Rafael Correa the  centers are rendering more general medical care and are expanding pharmacy  resources. Even dentists may be present to perform extractions, place fillings,  and do cleanings. However, the centers remain poorly staffed, often with one  year rotations by assigned young physicians, or by public health nurses. They  are undersupplied, with a limited and inconsistent formulary. The doctor  sometimes is available in each village only one or two days each month.<br />
	Government specialists in some cases may also run  private offices on the side.<br />
	A few regional hospitals are present, some with  out-patient clinics. Access has improved but the standard of care is  inconsistent. There remain private physicians for the more affluent elite. They  now charge as much as $20 dollars for a consultation, and owning their own  pharmacies, prescribe as much as $50 dollars each visit for various tablets and  injections. This far surpasses the average family weekly income of less than  $60. The poor are disenfranchised. &nbsp;Furthermore if they failed to register  in advance with their local government health center on the assigned day they  are not eligible for free care.<br />
	Patients can be seen without charge at the  government run facilities. Yet they clearly endorse the value of the Clinica Misional  Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe by lining up as early as five o&rsquo;clock in the  morning for what is perceived as good care.<br />
	Our laboratory still includes centrifuges, a  semi-automated desk top chemistry analyzer, a QBC blood count machine, desktop  microscopes, a lipid meter, and an assortment of quick screen tests and  reagents. Not all of the equipment is in good working order or with reagents  available. It is difficult to maintain. In part this is because not all  physicians agree upon the utility of performing these examinations and with  notice of the economic status of our patients tests are ordered selectively.<br />
	The most common tests utilized include blood  glucose, CBC, spun hematocrit, urinalysis, and urine pregnancy test. There are  quick screens for elevated TSH, Chlamydia, Helicobactor Pylori antibody,  Infectious Mononucleosis, and HIV.&nbsp; KOH and wet mount microscopic  examinations can be performed on vaginal secretions and skin scrapings. India  Ink, Giemsa, and Gram Stain material are available.<br />
	During our visit we saw an average of 20  patients each day. We did not overlap with surgeons. When they are present the  volume dramatically rises for all personnel, with the primary care physician  called upon to examine about twice as many individuals. Electronic health  records facility patient care.<br />
	I participated in an Jornada Medica. In two days  the medical student, a German dentist and nurse, and Amanda Anderson, who for  10 years has served as the clinic administrator, joined me in visiting two  small towns three hours from the main clinic site of Guadalupe. 194 medical  patients of all ages were seen and 66 rotted and painful teeth extracted.<br />
	The first 4 years of the clinic, pharmaceutical  companies donated large amounts of medications. This supplemented donations  from Austria and Germany. The facility ultimately was certified to receive  discounted medicines from international charitable organizations such as MEDIOR  and BLESSINGS. Since 2010 it has become increasingly difficult, and  prohibitively expensive because of regulations and tariffs, to bring supplies  into the country. We can no longer rely upon outside sources. By necessity more  items are purchased locally including increasingly available generic drugs. Our  pharmacy is now without access to significantly discounted pharmaceuticals and  will soon run at a loss as we insure that medications remain affordable to  those who most need them. Consultations remain priced at $1 each visit and for  some of the less fortunate even this fee is waived. To increase the charge  would mean that large segments of this rural population will no longer be seen.  A clinic for the poor cannot survive on collected revenue. During my visit we  had extensive discussions as how to ensure the economic viability of the  facility while remaining faithful to the mission&rsquo;s founding charitable  principles.<br />
	Generous public support is essential to sustain  the facility.&nbsp; Secure donations may now be made electronically through the  website to the A 501 C3 tax exempt foundation &ldquo;The Friends of the Mission  Clinic of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Inc.&rdquo;<br />
	The 10 year anniversary of the dedication of the  clinic occurred just prior to my coming. The outpouring of public officials and  community leaders attests to the high respect in which the health facility is  regarded. Plaques were awarded and are now mounted for each of us to see.<br />
	Despite these many difficulties the Clinical  Misional Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe is increasingly successful at meeting the  unmet health needs of the region, giving additive value to the services  rendered by the government run Subcentro de Salud.<br />
	It is a remarkable place to volunteer.<br />
	I am already planning my next visit.</p>

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="treatments" id="treatments"></a>Thoughts about treatments of common complaints and  diseases</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">Depression is always in  the background whenever someone visits with chronic and recurrent difficulties.  Also musculoskeletal problems are rampant in this setting. &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li class="erfahrung"><strong>Paresthesias of  palms and soles:</strong><br />
		Eczema  may play a role. This and fungal infections are predisposed to by the damp  environment and wearing rubber boots. Other possibilities may include iron and  other vitamin deficiency&nbsp;or anemia from whatever cause. The diet is not  very balanced and green vegetables and red meat are in short supply. Diabetes,  mainly non insulin dependent, is also more common than I might have thought  prior to my visits and certainly can contribute to neuropathy. Although you may  treat empirically, a glucose and spun hematocrit on select patients might be  useful. Lumbar or cervical radiculopathy may also be present, as back problems  are a common complaint. They often use the term kidney problem to mean that the  back hurts. When I could not tease out the problem I sometimes used the local  menthol cream or gave a trial of antidepressants (for neuropathy) or vitamins,  but individualized as best as possible for the most likely diagnosis.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li class="erfahrung"><strong>Dysuria:</strong><br />
		Dysuria  in women seemed to go hand in hand with chronic vaginitis and sometimes pelvic  prolapse and atrophic vaginitis. Many men seemed to have chronic prostatitis.  Only sporadically did I see urethritis. Although people seemed to think that  they had kidney stones only a few did, and their urine sediment was usually  active. I did see some urinary tract infections. The clinical examination was  often the best way to sort this out. Urinalysis and vaginal smears could be  helpful in select cases. If I saw a heavy purulent discharge I might treat for  gonorrhea with perhaps a quinolone, and also cover with a macrolide for  chlamydia, but we are not able to culture, and gram staining is cumbersome if  no one in the laboratory will ! do it for you and patients are waiting.  Prostatitis I treated with 10 days of a quinolone or macrolide. Vaginitis I  tried to treat a bit more specifically by its&rsquo; apparent etiology.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li class="erfahrung"><strong> Chronic  vaginitis:</strong><br />
		This  is problematic. There may be a psychological overlay to this complaint. At  times this may reflect marital discord or other sexual issues. That being said,  I did a number of vaginal smears. I have yet to see trichomonas. Surprisingly  frequently I came across clue cells. Much less common than I expected was  monilia. I think that treating for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or  clindamycin or perhaps amoxicillin may be reasonable if you do not see finding  of yeast. If suspecting chlamydia or  gonorrhea&nbsp;you&nbsp;should&nbsp;individualize the medication. I do think  that man! y women are actually re-infected by their husbands after initial  successful therapy. Extra marital sex and using prostitutes in not unusual.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li class="erfahrung"><strong>Bitter  taste:</strong><br />
		Reflux  is not uncommon. I think this is more common than true ulcers.&nbsp;I suspect  there may be some helicobacter present. Studies elsewhere in the developing  world have shown this not to be uncommon. Some patients came to me with  endoscopy reports consistent with this. I was told by the nurse Amanda  that&nbsp;there are&nbsp;people who vomit worms. I think that treating for  ascariasis is not unreasonable in selected cares as the presenting complaint  may be not just bloating but foul taste. Giardiasis may also give indigestion.  Finally think of dental pathology. Our dental colleagues seem to have endless  amounts of work.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li class="erfahrung"><strong>Abdominal  pain:</strong><br />
		I  do think that parasitic infestation is ubiquitous in this setting. I have  seen&nbsp;laboratory studies&nbsp;brought in by patients with the presence of  giardiasis and amebiasis. I think the anecdotal reports of passing worms argues  for ascariasis. Rarely there may be other parasites such as cystocercosis, but  I do not think that we will diagnose this in our rural clinic. I think that  amebiasis seems to manifest in this population as a more chronic and indolent  disorder than we are used to in our countries. Of course if febrile or diarrhea  other bacterial or inflammatory conditions are in the differential.  Constipation is always a possibility. Again, the diet could be better. Keep  in&nbsp;mind that children and menstruating or pregnant women are at greater  risk of anemia if afflicted with parasites. When in doubt I treat adults  with&nbsp;giardia or ameba&nbsp;with Tinidizole 2 grams &nbsp;once, or  Metronidazole 500 mg TID x 1 week. Young children are more at risk from seizure  with Tinidizale so should receive Metronidazole dosed by size. For worms  consider giving adults Abendazole 400 mg once, or Mebendazole 200 mg BID for  three days. For children give the same in scaled down dosage.<br />
		I think that we can  treat most of what we see empirically using our clinical judgement. Sometimes I  think that we appreciate having the laboratory, and not just the machines. A  microscope is a wonderful instrument.</li>

  <br />
  I had the  opportunity to return to Ecuador the first three weeks of December 2012. The  first week I overlapped with Dr. Burger Zapf. He is an otolaryngologist and  long time volunteer at the Clinica Misional. Prior to my arrival another otolaryngologist  and an anesthesiologist had been present. With no anesthesia specialist that  week the government hospital in Zamora donated the use of an operating theater  and a staff anesthesiologist for several days. The level of cooperation between  the local health ministry, facility administrators and Padre Jorge Nigsch and Amanda  Anderson RN speaks volumes about the importance of our facility to the  community. With a surgical brigade present the volume of general medical  patients was high so that I averaged about 23 encounters a day and up to 35.  After Dr. Zapf left, and with the impending Christmas holidays, the volume fell  considerably to 5 to 15 clients daily. The dental census remained steady. The  pharmacy has slowly been simplified to include those drugs available in Ecuador  and affordable to the poor. At times our options for treatment are limited. The  awareness that the public health system is better supplied than in the past  also necessitates our adapting our prescription habits to be more appropriate to  each individual&rsquo;s situation.  In addition  there have been outside quazi governmental organizations more active in Ecuador  including Cuban physicians providing some mental health services and even  hearing aids.  The national health  minister is expanding care for the disabled, although services remain  rudimentary in the rural regions. As usual I saw a variety of acute illness and  chronic disease, the poor and some other less destitute seeking second opinion.  We continue to see patients who otherwise receive sporadic fragmented care. Our  electronic record allows our volunteers to provide a remarkable degree of  continuity of care. Having attended at the clinic annually since its founding,  I had several patients who I had seen in the past. It was gratifying to see  that my colleagues have provided good services despite at times difficult  conditions. There is no question that access to medical care in the community  has improved. Yet we are reassured every day by the patients who we see that we  remain an essential part of the regional health care delivery system.  Of course it is not all work. I participated  in cultural events honoring the patron saint Our Lady of Guadalupe. I  accompanied Padre to the small and more remote barrios as he celebrated mass. I  also hiked one weekend in the Podocarpus national park. As usual the collection  of volunteers made for good companionship, as the residence hall was full of  the sounds of Spanish, German and English with younger and older individuals  from the United States, Austria, Bulgaria and Chile sharing stories,  experiences, and meals.  The ecclesiastic  staff as usual welcomed us with open arms. I will return next year.</p>

<p class="erfahrung"><strong><a name="experience2013" id="experience2"></a>Experience  2013</strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">I returned to Ecuador to   work at the Clínica Misional Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe November 10  through November 29, 2013. I overlapped with a dentist Dr. Ekkehard Schlichtenhorst, a  German otolaryngologist Dr. Weibke Eisfeld, a North American otolaryngologist  Dr. Paul Fortgang, an Austrian anesthesiologist Dr. Viola Bissbort, an Suisse  nurse anesthetist Ms. Doris Bislin, a German dental technician Ms. Anne Coordt, a  Colombian  general practitioner Dr.  Miguel González Vélez, a recent medical school graduate Dr. Christina Eisfeld  and an operating room assistant, really an Austrian farmer and the brother of  Padre Nigsch, Mr. Hanspeter Nigsch. </p>
<p class="erfahrung"><strong><img src="images/Epstein_Serle_Miguel_Gonzalez.jpg" width="314" height="235" class="image_rightfloat_allsidemargin" /></strong>The second and third week about 50  surgeries in total were performed, with uncountable ambulatory consultations  and treatments given. On the general medicine side of the clinic about 27  patients daily were seen, as many as 40 in one day. The dentist and dental  technician had equally busy schedules. Although we remain hampered by our  inability to bring into the country medicines and other supplies, the local  resources, albeit still limited and at times too expensive for the poor, are  expanding and slowly becoming more affordable. Access to urgent care and  elective surgery can be difficult and we partially fill this role. We are  better equipped than the local Centro de Salud to care for many common chronic  illnesses. </p>
<p class="erfahrung">Individuals will travel great distances not just for surgery but to  use us for second opinions, coming with records and radiographs in hand. The  clinic has adapted to the ever changing array of government regulations, yet  again having undergone a health ministry inspection. The mixture of illnesses  remains the same, including some presenting quite late in the course of disease  with only limited care possible. The patients remain cordial and appreciative  of whatever we are able to do for them. </p>
<p class="erfahrung">As usual the hospitality of the nuns  and other mission personnel made our stay pleasant and productive. One weekend  a group of us hiked at an ecological park a short bus ride away. We were fortunate  to have dry weather with perfect conditions for our excursion. We remain  cognizant of the politics but are certain that our efforts are appreciated and  supported by the indigenous population that we serve. </p>
<p class="erfahrung">In the near future we  will have further specialty brigades with ophthalmology, another otolaryngology  team, and tentatively urology, gastroenterology and gynecology. General  surgeons were here recently and will return.   As the public health system expands coverage for primary care we  continue to supplement their efforts. I will be returning to Guadalupe next  December to give a respite to a longer term volunteer. I anticipate my visit  fondly, knowing the positive impact that we have had on the community. <br />

<p><strong><a name="experience2014" id="experience2014"></a>Experience 2014 </strong></p>
<p class="erfahrung">I had the  opportunity to return to Ecuador the first three week of December 2014. The  volume of patients is always high when surgical teams are present. In between,  as during the time of my recent visit, there are fewer individuals to be  served.  I saw between 6 and 20 patients  each session, averaging 11 patients daily. We experimented with Saturday and  Wednesday evening hours but this had little impact. The dentist was busy but  with sufficient time to treat multiple oral issues. There was  lack of a  technician to fashion partial dentures. Despite these short comings I would say  the experience was generally a good one. </p>
<p class="erfahrung">  Our role  has changed. The public health system has improved access considerably but  continues to struggle with providing urgent and specialty care in a timely  manner. It suffers from inadequate supplies. Some health centers are staffed by  younger less seasoned and prepared medical and dental providers. I had a young  man with a presumptive central retinal artery occlusion. This required an  immediate visit with an ophthalmologist. Through the government system this  would take weeks. Privately it would cost $30 to walk in the door and more for  medications and treatment. He went home and presumably lost his vision in that  eye. </p>
<p class="erfahrung">For  about one half of our patients we render both primary and acute care services.  For the others we do urgent visits, consultations and second opinions with  referral back to their usual physician, usually at a local Subcentro de Salud  or a smaller Puesto de Salud. I have changed the management on a number of such  patients, stopped unnecessary surgeries or have suggested a course of  evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few acute emergencies were seen and handled. One was  sent away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman with a severed tendon in her hand presented to  the clinic in the evening. I chose to send her to the hospital. 10 years ago I  would have attempted the repair myself despite my lack of training. She would  have had an even less experienced doctor to attend to her in the emergency room  and incurred significant expense. She most likely would have refused to go. Now  the chances are greater that she will see a surgeon.</p>
<p class="erfahrung">  The  government is considering consolidating the smaller health stations into larger  more regional community medical centers. Specialty care may be moved into the  cities. This may make sense in terms of quality. The unintended consequence is  that this change, and centralized appointment scheduling, but may further  hinder access from the more distant barrios. It is doing the same with small  schools, planning to close many of them and build larger and more central  facilities. It is uncertain how the children from the remote villages will  attend.</p>
<p class="erfahrung">  It is  now the Dispensorio Misional. It was so legally designated from the former name  of the Clinica Misional to better match government regulatory  requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our much more complete and subsidized pharmacy is  predominantly for our own usage. Surgeries may be performed on an ambulatory  basis but with the discouraging of the overnight bivouacking of patients.  Despite this in 2015 we have a German ophthalmology brigade for three weeks  starting mid January, a North American otolaryngology team for three weeks in  March and another otolaryngology group from Germany for several weeks in  November. We may have an Ecuadorean general surgeon for several days this  coming year but this is yet to be scheduled. Our general medical and dental  volunteer calendar is evolving.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="erfahrung">  I am  fortunate to continue to be affiliated with the Dispensorio Misional. I am  proud of its accomplishments. It is complementary to an improved government  health care system. It continues to provide an essential service.</p>

<p>After an absence of one year I returned to the Clinica  Misional Nuestra<br />
  Senora de Guadalupe short stay of only five days. I saw 84  general medical<br />
  patients and assisted with history and translation during  the surgical<br />
  screening of 12 more. The surgeons performed about 4 major  and 4 minor<br />
  procedures daily with many cleft palates but also a variety  of scar<br />
  revisions, nasal surgeries, a nerve repair, skin grafts for  burns and a few<br />
  cosmetic surgeries to help defray clinic costs. The fall in  volume for<br />
  primary care reflects an improved public health care system  but I still saw<br />
  a man unable to afford colostomy bags, a child with  inflammatory arthritis<br />
  on chronic steroids because her parents cannot take her back  to the<br />
  rheumatologist or pay for steroid sparing medications not  covered by the<br />
  state, and a woman choosing between her medications for  gastritis and her<br />
  antibiotics. The area continues to develop with expanded  paved roads, better<br />
  walking bridges across the Yacuambi River, and even a rural  Shuar village<br />
  getting an improved water supply. There is a new hotel in  town, inaugurated<br />
  with fire works and a priestly blessing, but so far without  guests. Padre<br />
  Jorge built a modern dormitory for catechists complete with  solar heated<br />
  water for the showers and rooms for the handicapped. Should  he eventually<br />
  return to Austria he will fix up the old place. The Austrian  plastic<br />
  surgical team spoke no Spanish and little English, have  worked together<br />
  before, and therefore were an insular group. The Austrian  dentist and German<br />
  dental technician were quite busy but most cheerful and  social. I had been<br />
  staying at the main parish priest residence. I took early  morning walks and<br />
  after work one day I took a swim in a local cold mountain  stream. It was<br />
  refreshing in the close to 100* weather. We ate together as  a group for<br />
  lunch and dinner and overlapped for breakfast. It was  remarkable how the<br />
  region continues to advance despite the national challenges  of falling oil<br />
  prices and the aftermath of the devastating earthquake along  to coast.</p>
