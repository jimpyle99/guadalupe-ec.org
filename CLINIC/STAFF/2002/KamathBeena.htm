        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Welcome to the Orientation Guide 
        for our Clinic.&nbsp; This information is based on my personal experiences 
        accumulated through my year of working here in Guadalupe.&nbsp; The Clinic 
        has been an amazing place to work, where the patients are truly 
        appreciative of your work and time, and come to call you “Doctors Who 
        Cure.”&nbsp; They leave their homes in the early morning hours to get in line 
        before our doors open, and wait for hours for their turn.&nbsp; It has been a 
        privilege and responsibility to have this kind of trust from the people 
        here.</span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">However, working in the Clinic 
        has also been very challenging.&nbsp; The cultural differences, different 
        concepts of medicine, lack of continuity of care, lack of adequate 
        auxiliary staff, oftentimes very basic medicines and equipment, and 
        language barrier can make treatment of the patients in this region very 
        difficult.&nbsp; In addition, coping with the slow rate at which change 
        occurs, in trying to improve the standard of care of the clinic, can be 
        frustrating at times.&nbsp; As the patients come to trust you more and more 
        and see that your type of medicine works, they will follow up, and then 
        the rewards are fulfilling in working here! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patients and their 
        appreciation of what you do make this job worthwhile.</span></font></p>

        newborn to old age.&nbsp; Depending on the experiences and abilities of the 
        doctors in the Clinic, you may be able to see the patients within your 
        specialty.&nbsp; For example, I am a pediatrician; however, during most of my 
        tenure here, I have been the only doctor, and thus have been seeing all 
        the patients, regardless of age.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">The patients range from very 
        poor to the middle class, from living in the countryside as farmers to 
        living in the city.&nbsp; Most of the patients work in agriculture, using 
        their machetes, planting, harvesting.&nbsp; Patients may also have other 
        jobs, including secretaries, teachers, bus drivers, construction 
        workers, miners.&nbsp; They have a range of economic wealth, some being 
        unable to afford even the simplest treatments, to others, who travel 
        from the bigger cities like Loja and will pay for many tests, consults 
        and medicines.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">There are three main cultural 
        groups:&nbsp; the Saraguro, the mestizo, and the Shuar.&nbsp; They tend to 
        intermarry within their own indigenous groups, thus are relatively 
        culturally homogenous.&nbsp; The Saraguro men usually have long braided hair, 
        with black short pants, and easy to distinguish black felt hats.&nbsp; The 
        women wear many layers of skirts, including a top pleated skirt, the 
        anako, paired with a colorful blouse, and elaborate beaded jewelry.&nbsp; The 
        Shuar have a typical facial appearance with high cheekbones.&nbsp; Both 
        groups use traditional medicine, things such as “uña del gato”, or 
        “sangre de dragon,” or “horchattas” or “aguas del monte” to cure illness 
        before seeking modern medicine. </span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">There are some important 
        cultural distinctions that can make treating these patients more 
        difficult.&nbsp; First of all, the reliance upon traditional medicines and 
        natural remedies cannot be discounted.&nbsp; As a general rule, patients try 
        natural remedies before entering your consultorio.&nbsp; Secondly, their 
        representation of illness is often more dramatic and the symptoms are 
        different than what you may be used to.&nbsp; Use all of your physical exam 
        skills to determine if the symptoms are truly worrisome.&nbsp; For example, I 
        had a Shuar woman writhing with a complaint of all over body pain, with 
        a pulse of 60.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rely on your clinical judgment in these cases, as 
        often, their history and exam do not mesh well.&nbsp; The Shuar also have a 
        reputation of putting blame on those that help them, looking for a 
        reason that an illness was caused (there is much prejudice against them 
        for this very reason).&nbsp; I can give many experiences in which the Shuar 
        have been extremely challenging patients for their reliance on 
        traditional medicine, their lack of understanding of modern medicine, 
        their refusal to go to the hospital in case of emergency.</span></font></p>

        have had surgeries, and be unable to tell you exactly why.&nbsp; They may

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">This is one of the greatest 
        frustrations of working in the Clinic.&nbsp; Doing a Past Medical History, 
        Past Surgical History and Current Medication List can make you grit your 
        teeth and want to scream.&nbsp; I have had several patients tell me that they 
        had “tumors” but were unable to tell me in which organ, and why the 
        tumor was removed, or if it was cancerous!&nbsp; Do not even think about 
        asking for pathology reports….I even had one woman tell me that she kept 
        her uterus in formaldehyde at home, and told me that she could bring the 
        jar for me to examine.</span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Part of the problem, in my 
        opinion, comes from a lack of education on the part of the patients, a 
        misunderstanding of basic concepts of health, and a lack of patient 
        education on the part of other doctors who have treated the patient and 
        not given clear explanations for the illness nor the medications.</span></font></p>

        of education regarding taking responsibility for one’s own health care, 
        including bringing prior records, boxes or prescriptions of the 
        medicine, or lab results, in addition to demanding from other doctors 
        simple explanations for the illnesses that they have.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of 
        the biggest differences in health education that you can make during

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Right now, the order in which 
        you see patients is in the order in which they arrive, in fact, the 
        patients will fight each other to cut in the line in order to be first, 
        etc.&nbsp; It is hard to place judgments on the order to see the patients 
        when certain have traveled extremely far to arrive to see you.&nbsp; There is 
        no time for you to do the triage, nor has there been enough staff with 
        the experience to triage well.&nbsp; Thus, we tend to attend to the patients 
        in the order in which they arrive.</span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Occasionally, the nurses will 
        alert you to a particularly sick patient that needs attention earlier.&nbsp; 
        Many times, the patients will make themselves out to be sicker than they 
        really are in order to be attended to earlier.&nbsp; Thus, I let the nurses 
        screen these patients so that I may be seeing the patients in the order 
        in which they were assigned.&nbsp; This is our rough system of triage, which 
        is not always the greatest to pick up sick patients.&nbsp; In addition, 
        taking a patient out of order makes the other patients, who may have 
        traveled further or waited longer, very angry.</span></font></p>

        obvious emergencies, such as a deformed arm, a bleeding cut,&nbsp; are 
        attended to immediately, but others, with not so obvious sicknesses, are 
        left waiting.&nbsp; Thus, there are holes in this form of triage.&nbsp; A cyanotic 
        infant was not recognized.&nbsp; Or I have been asked to see a child just 
        because he was crying, without vital signs being taken.&nbsp; There have been 
        several times when asthmatics have sat in the hall for hours, waiting, 
        when they could have been quickly evaluated, and steroids and albuterol 
        nebulizers begun.&nbsp; In addition, I have had children sit the hallway 
        without anti-pyretics to bring down fever.&nbsp; Little by little, we are

        with Fluphenazine and Nortriptyline for an infant’s colic!&nbsp; (Regulations 
        are starting to pop up to control this more and more, but as of yet, 
        there has not been much control over this unofficial use of 
        medication.)&nbsp; Thus a patient will often self-treat with medication or 
        natural remedies before arriving to the Clinic.&nbsp; Most commonly, people

        </span><font face="Arial" size="2">Desire for Injections:&nbsp; Many patients desire injections.&nbsp; There 
        is a conception that injections work faster and stronger than other 
        medicines, even though they are more expensive.&nbsp; In addition, patients 
        think that one injection will cure an illness.&nbsp; For example, many use 
        one injection of Gentamicin to cure a common cold.&nbsp; Many want “sueros,” 
        or IV injections of vitamins or other medicines to cure illness, and 
        some even know how to put in their own IVs at home to give intravenous 
        medications.&nbsp; Another example is IM Diclofenac for musculoskeletal 
        pain.&nbsp; The most dangerous example are the patients who desire IV CALCIUM 
        for their bone pains!&nbsp; Patients do occasionally share needles with 
        injections.&nbsp; The perception exists that a quick shot of medicine is all 
        they need to cure most illness.&nbsp; In my time here, I have rarely given 
        injections as to not feed into this dependence on injections and instead 
        have tried to educate on the risks of injections, such as higher cost, 
        risk of infection, etc.&nbsp; If the patient can swallow, I do not give 
        injections.&nbsp; I also try to educate the patients WHY injections are not 
        needed, when the patient is capable of buying a tablet, that he can 
        swallow, that costs less, and avoids risks on injections.<br>

        for a “quick fix,” an injection that will quickly cure their illness, 
        the patients need to be more educated regarding chronic illness, for 
        example, high blood pressure and diabetes, illnesses that are monitored 
        on a chronic basis and not treatable with a quick ten day course of 
        medicine.&nbsp; Patients need to understand clearly that they have a chronic 
        illness, and when you want to see them back.<br>

        (THIS ONE IS THE BIGGIE):&nbsp; The patients are very concerned regarding 
        vitamin deficiencies, although I have rarely seen a clearcut case of 
        vitamin deficiency.&nbsp; </span><b><span lang="EN-US">Instead of dispensing 
        a lot of vitamins, which are expensive, I have tried to do more 
        education of the balanced diet</span></b><span lang="EN-US">, and have 
        only given vitamins to pregnant women, children with poor growth, or 
        calcium to menopausal women.&nbsp; I have tried to avoid reinforcing this 
        worry about vitamin deficiencies by giving vitamins, except in clearcut 
        cases where I have seen actually vitamin deficiencies exist.&nbsp; Another 
        problem is that the vitamins that we do carry in the pharmacy do not 
        come in combinations that are useful for treating actual vitamin 
        deficiencies.&nbsp; For example, our vitamins for pregnant women do not have 
        an adequate amount of folate.&nbsp; The vitamins that we buy for children 
        focus on different types of Vitamin B, rather than calcium or iron.&nbsp; I 
        have not been able to find a combination vitamin that has the amounts 
        needed of recommended vitamins. </span><b><span lang="EN-US">Giving 
        vitamins, without also a discussion of a balanced diet, in my opinion, 
        is not providing quality care</span></b><span lang="EN-US">.&nbsp; (It takes 
        more time to explain a balanced diet, but the people have little 
        understanding of this!!&nbsp; Only giving vitamins reinforces the false 
        belief that they have that many conditions can be cured with vitamins.)&nbsp; 
        Many local doctors use Vitamin B shots (in the forms of Rojamin, 
        Neurogime, Neurobion, Beco 5) to cure a variety of illness to 
        miscarriage, musculoskeletal pain, any medical complaint.&nbsp; 
        Unfortunately, our Clinic does carry the Vitamin B shots, which does 
        send a mixed message to patients, even though I have NEVER prescribed 
        these during my time here.&nbsp; It would be a goal to STOP CARRYING VITAMIN 
        B PRODUCTS IN OUR PHARMACY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please continue to argue against Vitamin B 
        in the pharmacy.&nbsp; We have had discussions regarding selling of Vitamin 
        B, and currently, because our philosophy is to have a pharmacy that 
        serves the other doctors in the region, and they prescribe Vitamin B, we 
        continue to carry the Vitamin B.&nbsp; <br>

        fix, the patients are unsatisfied if the medicines do not work right 
        away.&nbsp; They are impatient to take a full course of medicine for 7 to 10 
        days, and will often take the treatment for a day or so before visiting 
        another doctor, who will most likely change your treatment.&nbsp; For this 
        reason, I try to reinforce the duration of treatment, and why it is 
        important to complete the treatment, and if the treatment does not work 
        well, make sure you tell them to come back.&nbsp; If they know that you want 
        to see them again, they will return instead of going to someone else.&nbsp; 
        Also, I try to give a clear idea of how many days they will need to get 
        better, and return precautions, symptoms or scenarios in which I will 
        worry that the treatment is not working well.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; “Your child 
        has a cold.&nbsp; His body will fight this over the course of 5-7 days.&nbsp; If 
        he has fever that lasts more than 3 days, vomiting with blood, pus 
        draining from his ear, is not drinking enough to produce one urine every

        just to keep them from going to another doctor who may give them 
        something completely useless, such as Vitamin B shots.&nbsp; If my giving a 
        child with a cold a cough syrup prevents them from going to another 
        doctor for a shot of penicillin, I err on the side of the cough syrup.&nbsp;

        the labs may not be doing the tests in the correct manner.&nbsp; For example, 
        the laboratories are not doing clean catch urines, so be wary of 
        contaminated urine specimens, for which the patients are actually 
        treated with antibiotics for infection.&nbsp; Thirdly, the labs are ordering 
        tests without doing consultas, and thinking through specifically what 
        lab tests the patient needs and why.&nbsp; Fourthly, I have been unsure at 
        times how much to rely on the validity of some of the test results.&nbsp;

        each patient.&nbsp; For example, the weights are helpful, as many patients 
        feel they are without appetite, and you can use the weight trend to 
        point out if they are losing or gaining.&nbsp; Simple, I know, but the 
        patients are unaware of their weights, as they have no way to weight 
        themselves at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, the nurses are only getting a measure 
        of temperature on people who have a history of fever, although some 
        people fall through the cracks, and never have the measurement done.&nbsp; (I

        Being a pediatrician, I have found the growth charts to rule out a 
        variety of serious illnesses, in addition to vitamin deficiencies, in 
        addition to allaying parents’ fears that their children are not growing 
        well.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the children of Ecuador tend to be shorter than 
        those in the US, especially when they are of the indigenous Shuar or 
        Saraguro cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that you can do is to measure both 
        parents, and calculate a midparental height.&nbsp; If only one parent

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Right now, our system of filing 
        the charts can be a bit aggravating.&nbsp; I have never been allowed to touch 
        the filing, in order that it not be confused more than it already is.&nbsp; 
        We often lose charts, or they are in the incorrect location, and this 
        can be frustrating when following a chronic patient, and for the amount 
        of time lost on busy days spent waiting on a missing chart.&nbsp; We have 
        been brainstorming ways to improve the charting system, but so far have 
        not implemented any changes, for a variety of complicating factors.&nbsp; The 
        patients have two first names and last names, and if they do not give 
        all four names, we may not find the correct chart, start a new chart on 
        the same patient, or lose their chart altogether.&nbsp; Sometimes the 
        patients may give a different name in order that you not find their 
        chart, so that they can get another medicine!&nbsp; In addition, the patients 
        have a cedula number to identify them, but they do not always carry the 
        card with the number, thus at times, even though it may be able to serve 
        like a Social Security Number, the patient may not have committed the 
        number to memory.&nbsp; There have been times when charts have been lost, or 
        exams that have been done, not documented.&nbsp; I have done my best to 
        document as much as possible, but sometimes, all the documentation is 
        lost in our mountains of charts.</span></font></p>

        separate.&nbsp; I have found this to be extremely helpful in treating 
        patients, as often, they do not remember what medicine or diagnosis the 
        specialist gave.&nbsp; With the plan to have more specialists, I hope that 
        this practice will be continued, as having five different charts on one 
        person makes the filing difficult and does not allow all of the medical 
        personnel to have the complete information on the patient, nor 
        collaborate together.&nbsp; The system is far from perfect, as oftentimes, 
        new charts are started when a patient already has an existing chart, but 
        little by little, it is improving.</span></font></p>

        has to travel for 4 or 6 hours to get here, they may not come.&nbsp; This can 
        be an issue, for example, to the dentists, when they put in a drain, and 
        need the patient to follow up to have the drain removed.&nbsp; <i>If the 
        patient starts to feel better after the initiation of treatment, they 
        may not come back.</i>&nbsp; For me, an example would be a patient that I 
        have done an incision and drainage of an abscess.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I ask the patient 
        to come back in several days, he may not, if the antibiotics are helping 
        him to get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sutured many lacerations, only to find that 
        the patients do not come back to have their sutures out.&nbsp; This also 
        occurs with chronic illnesses such as hypertension:&nbsp; when the patient’s 
        hypertensive headache is relieved by your medicine, he may not come 
        back, if he does not understand that once he suspends the medicine, his 
        headache will return.</span></font></p>

        patient care is lacking.&nbsp; Most of us in medicine like to see our 
        patients after they have been helped by our treatments, but in the cases 
        where our patients are better by our treatments here, they will not come 
        back.&nbsp; Sometimes, also, a patient that has not gotten better with a 
        treatment may switch to another doctor and not give you another chance 
        to make them better.&nbsp; Stress that you want the patient to return if they 
        are not feeling better, and they just might.</span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">In cases where you think that a 
        patient needs a higher level of care or admission to a hospital, you may 
        meet some resistance on the part of the patient to go to the hospital.&nbsp; 
        The perception of the hospital here is different than what you may be 
        used to:&nbsp; I would go to the hospital for more intense treatment, a 
        higher level of testing, and better around the clock care.&nbsp; For the 
        people here, they go to the hospital to die, and thus only in the most 
        grave of cases are they agreeable to go.&nbsp; This has been frustrating to 
        me at times, when I have felt limited in what I have been able to do 
        with the resources that are available in the Clinic.&nbsp; I do not recommend 
        practicing outside of your abilities, but at the same time, remember 
        that the patients have more TRUST in you than they do in the hospitals.&nbsp; 
        Oftentimes, they may not be admitted to the hospital without paying a 
        fee up front, or bringing along the medicines that they need for their 
        treatment.&nbsp; Thus, in some ways, what you can provide is better than what 
        a doctor in a hospital can do.&nbsp; Also, you may send a patient to the 
        hospital, where you already have the correct treatment in mind for the 
        patient to receive.&nbsp; The patient may go, and receive another treatment 
        entirely.&nbsp; For example, I had a patient with a closed head injury after 
        a fall from a stairwell.&nbsp; Immediately after the incident, she had 
        cervical neck pain, aniscocoria, headache, and nausea.&nbsp; I sent her to 
        the hospital for neck Xrays, and a CT scan if possible.&nbsp; They instead 
        did skull Xrays to rule out a skull fracture, and took her out of the 
        neck brace in which I had placed her without neck Xrays.&nbsp; So treatments 
        that may seem obvious to you in your own country are not necessarily 
        practiced here.&nbsp; Another example:&nbsp; a patient who was sent with a fixed 
        immobile neck mass for a cancer evaluation, who received an ultrasound 
        and antibiotics, without a biopsy nor pathology evaluation.&nbsp; FOR THAT 
        REASON, I NOW SEND PATIENTS WITH A REFERRAL LETTER DESCRIBING MY 
        DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS, WHAT TESTS I WOULD LIKE, AND WHAT TREATMENT I 
        INITIATED, IF ANY.</span></font></p>

        working in Guadalupe.&nbsp; The low status of women, their lack of education, 
        their inability to find work outside the home to provide for themselves 
        and a large brood of children, all contribute to women often being 
        powerless to defend themselves against the violence of men, or to leave 
        when they are victims of violence.&nbsp; Because of the culture of machismo, 
        in addition to the teachings of the Church, women are not encouraged to 
        leave an abusive situation.&nbsp; They are also hesitant to speak up that 
        abuse occurs.&nbsp; Being in a situation where little resources exist to help 
        the women escape makes helping them difficult, so I at least try to ask 
        the questions regarding abuse so that the women are aware that I care 
        about the issue, even if I have little to offer to better the 
        situation.&nbsp; We are hoping to offer self defense classes in the future,

        confessed to family members that the abuse has occurred.&nbsp; In most cases, 
        the victim is blamed for the abuse, thus making them afraid to speak out 
        that the abuse even occurred.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to speak to 
        some parents regarding their children who were abused, and help them 
        understand that putting the blame on their children is the incorrect 
        method.&nbsp; In addition, in this conservatively Catholic country, many

        have sent many patients to have the test done, but so far have not found

        the most common being low back pain.&nbsp; The patient may come in with 
        “dolor de los riñones” or kidney pain.&nbsp; They think that this pain comes 
        from their kidneys, and that kidney pain also manifests itself as 
        burning with urination, and burning of the feet.&nbsp; When I have seen how 
        hard the people work, carrying logs on their backs, macheting for the 
        whole day in the hot sun, walking for hours to reach their farms, miners 
        bent over in a tunnel all day, it is not surprising how much pain they 
        have.&nbsp; You may treat their pain now, but chances are, with their way of 
        working, the pain will return.&nbsp; I usually try to include some stretching 
        or exercises as part of treatment.&nbsp; In addition, I am probably more 
        liberal than most with the muscle relaxants, but I really think a lot of 
        the people have back spasm.&nbsp; I also try to be really clear that the pain 
        does NOT come from their kidneys, but their muscles that are tense from 
        their heavy labor.&nbsp; When you take the time to explain, it helps them in 
        the future not accept “kidney treatments” from other doctors.&nbsp; I also 
        try to explain very clearly that the pain does not come from a vitamin 
        deficiency, thus receiving vitamin shots does nothing to help the 
        problem.&nbsp; Musculoskeletal pain is probably the most common reason that 
        other doctors prescribe Vitamin B shots, so it pays to take the time to 
        do some health education in this area.&nbsp; In addition, I always try to 
        include some sort of exercise or stretching regimen to avoid the pain

        “nervios,” meaning that they are people who are very easily frightened, 
        sensitive, anxious.&nbsp; Parents often call their children “muy nervioso” 
        for many reasons:&nbsp; if the child cannot study well, if they scare easily, 
        if the mother was in bad mood when she was pregnant with that child. &nbsp;It 
        seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy more than anything else.&nbsp; These 
        patients tend to be very dramatic, and even worse, completely certain 
        that something is wrong with them.&nbsp; With the parents, I try to talk 
        about not putting these “nervous” ideas into the child’s heads, as I 
        have seen children faking attacks and fainting spells, from “nervios,” 
        when in reality, they were having problems with a brother leaving for 
        work in Spain.&nbsp; Other times, I have found people with real depression or 
        anxiety problems that needed medical treatment.&nbsp; I try to explain that 
        “nervios” as an illness in its own right does not exist, and there is 
        usually a problem in the home, within a marriage, other stress that 
        causes physical symptoms.&nbsp; I joke with them that the custom here is to 
        say “nervios” but a real illness with that name does not exist, and that 
        they have to examine their lives to find out from where the stress 
        comes.&nbsp; The people understand when you explain it to them in this 
        manner.<br>

        “fiebre.”&nbsp; They may not have had a real fever, and they have no way to 
        measure their temperature at home.&nbsp; For example, a patient with 
        gastritis may say that he has a fever in his belly, or a woman with a 
        headache may say that she has a fever in her head.&nbsp; It takes a little 
        further questioning to figure out if this was a real fever or not.&nbsp; 
        Complicating matters is the fact that the nurses do not get temperatures 
        on all patients, only those that report fever, thus probably missing 
        some patients with real fever.<br>

        </span><font face="Arial" size="2">VITAMINS:&nbsp; Usually at the end of the visit, a patient will slip 
        in that they need vitamins.&nbsp; Some patients are up front, blaming their 
        chief complaints on a “lack of vitamins.”&nbsp; Like I have mentioned 
        numerous times before, I tend to NOT give vitamins to feed into this 
        desire for vitamins, when probably they are not necessary, when 
        education on the balanced diet is sufficient.&nbsp; I tell the patients that 
        the custom here is to focus a great deal of attention on vitamins, when 
        at the same time, they need to remember that other things are 
        essential:&nbsp; calories to give energy and force to the body, and proteins, 
        fats, carbohydrates which play their own role in maintaining health.&nbsp; I 
        tell them that to focus only on vitamins is not correct, and only the 
        DIET can give them everything that they need.&nbsp; This is another instance 
        that spending several minutes on health education can pay off.&nbsp; It would 
        be easy to write the patient off by giving them vitamins, but then we 
        are forgetting our responsibility to educate.<br>

        their hunger with candy, cola, sweets, and then have no room to eat 
        food.&nbsp; With these parents, I talk about restricting sweets, review the 
        balanced diet, and give a parasite medication.&nbsp; I review the child’s 
        growth chart with the parents to show them that the child is growing 
        normally, thus is receiving enough nutrition to maintain a normal 
        weight.&nbsp; I DO NOT GIVE VITAMINS unless there is a clearcut growth 
        deficiency.&nbsp; And I ask the parents to follow up every 6 months for a 
        measurement of the growth, and to repeat the parasite medication.</font></span></p>

        the few missions that exists in the world with such an international 
        crew.&nbsp; In my time, we have had nationals from the US, Ecuador, Colombia, 
        Austria, Germany, Italy, and Ireland.&nbsp; We speak Spanish, English, and 
        German.&nbsp; People of a variety of religious faiths have lived and worked 
        in the Mission.</span></font></p>

        living in a Catholic Mission, and will be eating your meals and spending 
        time with Sisters of the Teresita order of nuns.&nbsp; A great side benefit 
        of working in Guadalupe is the chance to know the Sisters, talk with 
        them, and spend time with them.&nbsp; They have a wonderful sense of humor, 
        and are very caring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Padre Jorge, the priest who founded the Clinic 
        and who has lived in Guadalupe for over 10 years, is a very 
        approachable, fun, and understanding person, who is very appreciative of 
        all the work that you do.&nbsp; Part of the most enjoyable part of working 
        here is becoming a part of this unique family.</span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Because you are living at a 
        Catholic mission, prayers are said before and after meals, and Catholic 
        Mass is often held at the Church near the Clinic.&nbsp; You are welcome to 
        attend Mass, but it is not a requirement.&nbsp; Being a non-Catholic myself, 
        I have enjoyed participating in the religious aspect of life here, 
        because it is an important part of the culture of the patients, and my 
        friends here.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">That being said, oftentimes, the 
        rigidity of the schedule of the Convent can oftentimes be a bit 
        oppressive.&nbsp; The meals are at 7:30, 12:00 and 6 PM every day, and when 
        the Clinic schedule is full, you may not leave until 6 PM.&nbsp; I have 
        occasionally enjoyed taking a day to myself, to cook for myself in the 
        Residence, or take some time to go for a walk or play basketball before 
        dinner.&nbsp; Thus, guard your free time, if you like to exercise, cook, or 
        just want a day off to eat on your own, feel free to do that.&nbsp; </span>

        her own, and come to understand a great deal about the culture and 
        practices here.&nbsp; From my year here, and being the first longstanding 
        doctor volunteer, I have a special personal investment in the Clinic and 
        in the manner in which I would like to see it progress.&nbsp; Padre Jorge has 
        set a vision that we will provide a standard of care above and beyond

        thousands as the word of our quality care continues to grow.&nbsp; We have 
        had a growth in the number of volunteers.&nbsp; We have renovated the nursing 
        station with paintings on the wall for children, added bookcases to 
        various rooms, CLEANED OUT A LOT OF JUNK.&nbsp; In addition, we have 
        increased in our efforts to do basic health education as part of the 
        medical visits, with emphasis on balanced diet rather than vitamins, 
        wound care, exercise, care of the body while working.&nbsp; </span>

        our patients travel for hours to receive our care, may not be able to 
        return expeditiously to follow up on treatment, and the cultural barrier

        have a level of pride regarding the quality care that we provide.&nbsp; The 
        following are things that I have been fighting for in my time here, and 
        with my leaving, I hope that I can leave this mission to you, those who 
        follow me, in helping this Clinic to be all that it can be.&nbsp; That being

        three ways:</span></font></p>

        </font>
        </span><font face="Arial" size="2">For everything that we can do, do it to the best of our ability.&nbsp; 
        For example, doing complete vital signs on every patient, a simple 
        intervention, yet so pertinent to quality care, needs to be continued.&nbsp; 
        When we withhold doing the things that can be done easily for lack of 
        time or patience, such as vital signs, we are not providing quality 
        care.&nbsp; When we do lab tests, do them correctly:&nbsp; clean catch midstream 
        urines were not being done until I instructed the nurses how to do 
        them.&nbsp; Obese people were having blood pressures done with a normal adult 
        cuff.&nbsp; This is BASIC MEDICAL CARE, and when we fail to do this 
        correctly, we are failing in our mission.<br>

        </font>
        </span><font face="Arial" size="2">The Clinic should strive to have the best and CORRECT care for 
        the patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oftentimes, I see us practicing a bit of hypocrisy, and 
        slowly slowly slowly things are changing.&nbsp; One example:&nbsp; we tell the 
        patients to brush their teeth and not eat sweets, yet we only recently 
        decided to stop selling candy in the pharmacy after much debate and 
        discussion.&nbsp; (The dentists who have recently filled cavities LOVE 
        this.)&nbsp; Thankfully the change occurred, but it has been a long time in 
        coming, and we now have sugar free cookies and candies at the pharmacy.&nbsp; 
        Another example:&nbsp; I preach against vitamin shots, yet we have them in 
        the pharmacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, other doctors are using the pharmacy and 
        prescribing things like Vitamin B shots, and for that reason, we 
        continue to buy Vitamin B shots, but my hope is that in the future, the 
        people will be educated enough to NOT WANT these things.&nbsp; It would be my 
        hope that the Clinic will stop carrying worthless medicines that waste 
        the patients´ money, and are bought from anyone other than a certified 
        drug representative.&nbsp; We cannot save nor attend to everyone in the 
        region, but we can set an example of the medicine that we will and will 
        not carry, setting a standard for what medicines work and what does 
        not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The WHO and Doctors without Borders both have guidelines for 
        pharmacies that can be used to help us in making decisions on what 
        medicines to buy, although many of the medicines that we receive in 
        donations are much more sophisticated that the basics that they have 
        listed.<br>

        I hope that this may be continued, with more outreach into the barrios 
        to educate the people regarding these basic health fundamentals.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
        important to stress these things in treatment discussions with the 
        patients, as I try to tell them that these things are just as important, 
        and less expensive, than buying a lot of medicine.<br>
