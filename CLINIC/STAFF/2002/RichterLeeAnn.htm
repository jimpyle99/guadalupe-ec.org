          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">I spent a 
          wonderful 3 ½ months in Guadalupe working mostly in outreach and 
          education but also in the clinic as a medical translator, taking 
          medical histories, and doing vital signs.&nbsp; Although I am not a 
          physician, I worked very closely with many who came through and know 
          what it is like to work with the patients and generally which 
          approaches work well.&nbsp; After my time in Guadalupe I have a pretty good 
          idea of what life is like in the clinic, at the mission, and as a 
          member of the town.&nbsp; Based on my pre-trip concerns and what I learned,

          It is easier to pick up Spanish if you come having at least some 
          background.&nbsp; Life is much more fun if you can communicate with the 
          people you work with, the old women who sit all day on their porches, 
          the shopkeepers selling fried pork, and the kids that run around town

          unsatisfied if you suggest a lifestyle change, such as stopping 
          smoking or exercise as opposed to prescribing a “miracle drug” which 
          will solve the problem for them.&nbsp; It is important therefore to make 
          the patient seem empowered by their ability to improve their own

          can not be cured, but that things can be done to calm symptoms, slow 
          progression, and improve quality of life with the disease.)&nbsp; It may 
          feel that you are spelling out too much for the patient but it is 
          surprising how much people do not understand about taking medication, 
          diseases, and health –and much better that they know how to take the

          Guadalupe, Ecuador 2004</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          During the 4 months I spent working and teaching in a rural health 
          clinic I thought I had learned the most important concepts of clinical 
          care. But it was a house call, 3 hours from the closest village, where 
          I witnessed how to administer the most valuable and intangible 
          treatment. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          After 3 hours on a rickety crowded bus, we still had 3 more to go to 
          reach our patient. The roads in this part of southern Ecuador did not 
          allow for fast traveling. <a href="KamathBeena.htm">Beena</a>, the 
          American doctor, and I rode from our small village for 3 hours until 
          the dirt road dead-ended in another village. It was the last village 
          accessible by bus, where we then had to mount horses to ride into the 
          Andes. The patient's father met us with horses to travel the 3 
          remaining hours to his home. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          Until this time all we knew was that his son was 18 years old and had 
          been unable to walk for 3 years. He had slowly developed a paralysis 
          that crept up his body and weakened him until he was no longer able to 
          get out of bed. Mentally he was alert, aware and intelligent as other 
          18 year olds, however his body had failed him, succumbing to the 
          paralysis and gradually seizing as his muscles atrophied from lack of 
          use. The father could not explain his son's illness, but seemed 
          assured that this doctor from the United States would be able to give 
          his son an injection that would reverse the effects of 3 years. His 
          reasoning was that he knew others who had received injections and were 
          suddenly cured of paralysis-like symptoms. He felt confident that this 
          American doctor would make his son walk again. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          Beena, the young physician whom I had been helping in the rural health 
          clinic was nervous about this house call, as was I. Before we left the 
          clinic, she had read up on polio, believing that to be a likely cause 
          of this man's symptoms. Together we brainstormed ways of helping 
          improve the quality of life for this bedridden man given the fact that 
          his family had no source of income, there were no medical resources in 
          the vicinity, and any medicine we could leave with his family would 
          most likely not be able to be replaced once it ran out. How could we 
          give the most to this young man without having many resources to rely 
          on?</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          The wooden slat house was perched on a hillside with the Andean 
          mountains in the background. Beena and I were introduced to the mother 
          as the younger siblings ran around the yard, peaking around corners to 
          stare and whisper. I was curious as to how Beena would perform this 
          unusual consultation. We were brought in to see the patient in his 
          room. He looked young, much younger than 18, and his body was seized 
          up and skinny- clearly he would never walk again. I felt chills 
          standing in the room that had made up this man's entire world for the 
          last 3 years. His eyes, however, expressed a different message than 
          the one his shriveled body projected. Vitality hidden within his 
          atrophied frame escaped thru his eyes and radiated in the room.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I 
          watched as Beena walked into the room and approached the patient, 
          looking into his eyes calmly and genuinely expressing pleasure to meet 
          him. She sat on a cot beside his bed and went through a detailed 
          medical history, directing his story chronologically but otherwise 
          letting him tell his tale. When she asked what he hoped she could do 
          for him, his mother interjected that she expected Beena could make her 
          son walk again, that she must have an injection that would cure her 
          son. Our patient, however, did not make such statements; he seemed to 
          be more understanding of his own situation. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          What Beena then did was remarkable. She told the blatant and 
          disheartening truth in the most respectful and humane way she could 
          have. I watched her explain to the parents that what their son had 
          could not be cured by an injection she had, nor could he be made able 
          to walk again by anything that the medical world could offer. That 
          being said, she went through all the things that were in great health 
          with their son and what they could do, together with him, to improve 
          his quality of life. She not only described exercises and massages 
          they could help him with but showed them how to do them, making sure 
          they understood.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
          What Beena gave this family was more than anything she could have 
          provided in resources, whether in rural Ecuador or in the Unites 
          States. She left them with an honest reality, but more importantly, 
          she left them informed as to how to make that reality as rewarding as 
          it could possibly be. She left an intangible but unending gift, 
          knowledge empowering them to make beneficial changes in the quality of 
          their son's life.</span></p>
