           has created an environment infused with creativity, innovation, and 
           purpose. The populace has great medical and emotional needs. But the 
           culture is rich. The fusion of European and Indian values intrigues 
           me, When one sees what Padre is trying to do for his people, and how 
           he is succeeding, the effort is infectious. I am drawn by a sense of 
           being part of something larger than myself, and, since I am 
           witnessing the beginning of the clinic, of using my skills to in a 
           small way shape the health care environment of the Oriente for the 
           future. Freed from other every day concerns it is the essence of 
           service, almost religious in a religious environment. No matter how 
           hard one works, one helps only a few villagers at a time. However one 
           sets an example of professionalism for others who practice locally or 
           who will follow. And of course there is the opportunity to help the 
           person across from you, who in our community has many options even if 
           poor, but in Ecuador would have no where else to turn. I have a 
           romantic notion that the lack of compensation, and the difficulty of 
           practice in that environment, may make the act of giving even more 
           special and rewarding, a sense of purity of purpose, and sense of 
           accomplishment and lack of commercialism. The Padre and Hermanas and 
           villagers make it eminently clear that they are grateful. The people 
           pay what they can for your service. All of this more than makes up 
           for any frustration...</font><span lang="es-ec"><font lang="0" style="background-color: #ffffff" face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF">&quot;</font></span><font lang="0" style="background-color: #ffffff" face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF"><br>

            wished to give an update on the progress of this three year 
            old&nbsp;facility.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to volunteer on three 
            occasions at this modern medical clinic.&nbsp;It is located on the 
            grounds of a Catholic mission in the Ecuadorean Amazon, the Oriente, 
            along the Peruvian border. There are examining rooms, dental suites, 
            an operating theatre, a pharmacy, and a laboratory. Currently 
            attending is a pediatrician from the United States who has been 
            practicing general medicine for&nbsp;nine months, and will do so for 
            another three. In addition there have been, and will continue to be, 
            a steady stream of physicians coming for shorter stays, including 
            internists, general practitioners, pediatricians, ophthalmologists 
            and an otolaryngologist.&nbsp;There have also been physician assistants 
            and advanced nurse practitioners. They have begun outreach programs 
            and periodic mobile health fairs to even more remote locations. The 
            facility serves an immediate population consisting of about three 
            thousand persons in seven villages, but has remarkably been drawing 
            patients from the entire provence of thirty thousand. Between the 
            dentists, primary care physicians and surgeons, the average patient 
            burden is about fifty visits each day and up to a staggering and 
            overwhelming two hundred when surgury is performed. There is an 
            opportunity for a volunteer primary care physician to work for 
            several months to a year in addition to those who are able to come 
            for a briefer sojourn. This might enable a certain amount of 
            continuity of care supplemented by the efforts of other shorter term 
            health care workers. Openings start late this coming summer into 
            next year for internists, pediatricians, family and general 
            practitioners, ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists and 
            dentists.&nbsp;Room and board is free but travel is not reimbursed. 
            Although a knowledge of Spanish is helpful there is a bilingual 
            nurse on premise. Based at a Catholic mission, all faiths are 
            welcome, but a respect for religion is important. </font>
