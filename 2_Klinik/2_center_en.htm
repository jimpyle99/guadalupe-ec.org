Primary care health care workers including physicians and advanced nurse 
practitioners, and dentists, are needed to help see the indigenous population 
that is served by this modern clinic in the Ecuadorian tropical highland along 
the Peruvian border. There is also a need for ophthalmologists, 
otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, and general surgeons in the near future 
when the operating room is fully functional. The clinic is situated at a 
Catholic mission in the village of Guadalupe along the main trade route into the 
Amazon. The nearest hospital is several hours away. The clinic has examining 
rooms, an operating room, and dental rooms with dental x-ray. There is a well 
stocked pharmacy. There is a rudimentary laboratory. Some access to commercial 
laboratory and radiology is available. Volunteers can come for as little as&nbsp;two 
weeks or for several months. Travel is not reimbursed but room and board is 
covered with comfortable accommodations at the mission. A knowledge of Spanish 
is helpful however&nbsp;a bilingual nurse is present. All faiths are welcome, but 
respect for religion is essential. </font> </span></font>

I wished to give an update on the progress of this three year old facility. I 
have had the opportunity to volunteer on three occasions at this modern medical 
clinic. It is located on the grounds of a Catholic mission in the Ecuadorean 
Amazon, the Oriente, along the Peruvian border. There are examining rooms, 
dental suites, an operating theatre, a pharmacy, and a laboratory. Currently 
attending is a pediatrician from the United States who has been practicing 
general medicine for nine months, and will do so for another three. In addition 
there have been, and will continue to be, a steady stream of physicians coming 
for shorter stays, including internists, general practitioners, pediatricians, 
ophthalmologists and an otolaryngologist. There have also been physician 
assistants and advanced nurse practitioners. They have begun outreach programs 
and periodic mobile health fairs to even more remote locations. The facility 
serves an immediate population consisting of about three thousand persons in 
seven villages, but has remarkably been drawing patients from the entire 
provence of thirty thousand. Between the dentists, primary care physicians and 
surgeons, the average patient burden is about fifty visits each day and up to a 
staggering and overwhelming two hundred when surgury is performed. There is an 
opportunity for a volunteer primary care physician to work for several months to 
a year in addition to those who are able to come for a briefer sojourn. This 
might enable a certain amount of continuity of care supplemented by the efforts 
of other shorter term health care workers. Openings start late this coming 
summer into next year for internists, pediatricians, family and general 
practitioners, ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists and dentists. Room and board 
is free but travel is not reimbursed. Although a knowledge of Spanish is helpful 
there is a bilingual nurse on premise. Based at a Catholic mission, all faiths 
are welcome, but a respect for religion is important. ....... You may contact 
Padre Jorge Nigsch directly at nigsch57@easynet.net.ec Thus far we have had 
volunteers from the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Irland, and 
Great Britain. .....<br>
We were at the Mission Clinic for one week in December 2001 when it opened. 
There is a local physician Dr. Jaime Ortiz who has been hired to attend once per 
week. There have been a stream of foreign dentists and last week 4 physicians 
from a city 3 hours away. The clinic has examining rooms, 2 dental rooms 
complete with dental x-ray, a surgical suite including a scrub room and 
recovery, and a pharmacy. The surgical area is not yet functional. Although the 
pharmacy has limitations we were able to treat most of what we saw. The clinic 
may soon have a basic laboratory. There is x-ray, laboratory, and surgical 
services in a city (Loja) 2 hours away for the few who can afford it and when 
the road is passable.<br>
The people were indiginous subsistance farmers with a few shopkeepers and 
miners. The gold mines are about one hour away. The oil companies are not in 
this particular region. There is malaria in the general area but little in the 
immediate vacinity. Similarly we did not see dengue or yellow fever. Mosquitos 
were present but not in great numbers. The water is not clean and that coupled 
with often the people sharing accomodations with their animals, giardia and 
worms were endemic. We saw some acute diarrhea and perhaps one person with 
typhoid fever. Many people had back pain (called kidney problems!) as well as 
depression, alcoholism, hypertension, and children with chronic ruptured 
tympanic membranes. We also saw all manner of other medical illness from 
dysfunctional vaginal bleeding to rheumatoid arthritis to parkinsonism to kidney 
stones. Some access to birth control is available in the city. Remarkably some 
people of greater means came from the city to this jungle clinic for second 
opinion, records in hand. Surgical supplies were present for suturing, draining, 
packing and casting, but analgesics and local anesthetics were deficient. 
Hopefully this has been rectified. The examining rooms are equipt but you may 
wish to bring a portable ophthalmoscope/otoscope as a backup as well as a 
glucometer, gloves, gel, and hemoccult cards.<br>
The parish is clean and accommodations quite comfortable with our own rooms and 
hot shower. The Nuns supplied us with preboiled water to drink and hearty meals 
safe to eat. We even felt comfortable eating the salads served to us by them, 
usually not a good idea in this setting. The Padre is from Austria. He has done 
remarkable things for his people in a place where the church does the social 
service tasks that are usually the purvue of the government. The government 
gives vaccinations sporatically and thus far this is not being performed by the 
clinic but perhaps in the future. The village is in the high tropical jungle 
along the main trade route to the amazon in Ecuador. It is poor but beautiful. I 
suggest that you be up to date for dT, polio, hepatitis a+b, and obtain yellow 
fever vaccine. You will need malaria prophyllaxis. I suggest a book Handbook of 
Medicine in Developing Countries by Catherine Wolf M.D. and Dennis Palmer D.O. 
Although mainly geared to the hospital it has usefull information in table 
format.<br>
The weather is most pleasant. It is about 75*F during the day, sometimes warmer, 
and 65*F at night, again sometimes warmer. It rains every day. I brought scrubs 
and a laboratory coat to work in and was most comfortable and felt adequately 
attired. One has to be wary of crime in Quito or Guayaquil but I felt perfectly 
safe in Guadalupe, especially as a guest of the parish mission. The currency is 
the US dollar. It goes far in Ecuador. There is little to spend it on in the 
village. We did not have a chance to be tourists but the beauty of the 
surroundings and the reward of helping others who appreciated the effort more 
than made up for it. They could use an operating microscope. If you know of any 
institution who might be able to donate one that would be terrific. That way ENT 
and basic Ophthalmology could be performed. Many children have ruptured TM's and 
many adults have cataracts and pterygeums.<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#CCFFCC"><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">The patients love lab tests! There seems 
to be no discernment in ordering tests to find out specific information; there 
is just a big random ordering of whatever tests for whatever reasons, without 
taking the time to think things through. Patients love to screen themselves for 
different diseases, and can go to a privately owned lab, where the lab owner is 
only too happy to mark up a lab sheet charging the patient for a CBC, lipid 
panel, BUN, Cr, SGOT, SGPT, Creactive protein, ASTO, Rhematoid factor. The 
patient will then bring these tests to you, having made their own diagnosis!<span lang="es">

</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">Incorrect use of medicine:&nbsp; In any store or local pharmacy, a 
        patient can walk in and buy medicine without a doctor’s prescription.&nbsp; I 
        have seen women walk into a pharmacy and purchase a combination pill 
        with Fluphenazine and Nortriptyline for an infant’s colic!&nbsp; (Regulations 
        are starting to pop up to control this more and more, but as of yet, 
        there has not been much control over this unofficial use of 
        medication.)&nbsp; Thus a patient will often self-treat with medication or 
        natural remedies before arriving to the Clinic.&nbsp; Most commonly, people 
        will buy one Ampicillin (Ampibex) tablet for a cold or skin infection, 
        or a Naprosyn (Apronax) for pain or infection.&nbsp; (2)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">Desire for Injections:&nbsp; Many patients desire injections.&nbsp; There 
        is a conception that injections work faster and stronger than other 
        medicines, even though they are more expensive.&nbsp; In addition, patients 
        think that one injection will cure an illness.&nbsp; For example, many use 
        one injection of Gentamicin to cure a common cold.&nbsp; Many want “sueros,” 
        or IV injections of vitamins or other medicines to cure illness, and 
        some even know how to put in their own IVs at home to give intravenous 
        medications.&nbsp; Another example is IM Diclofenac for musculoskeletal 
        pain.&nbsp; The most dangerous example are the patients who desire IV CALCIUM 
        for their bone pains!&nbsp; Patients do occasionally share needles with 
        injections.&nbsp; The perception exists that a quick shot of medicine is all 
        they need to cure most illness.&nbsp; In my time here, I have rarely given 
        injections as to not feed into this dependence on injections and instead 
        have tried to educate on the risks of injections, such as higher cost, 
        risk of infection, etc.(3)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">Misunderstanding of Chronic Treatments:&nbsp; Because of this desire 
        for a “quick fix,” an injection that will quickly cure their illness, 
        there needs to be more education regarding chronic illness, for example, 
        high blood pressure and diabetes, illnesses that are monitored on a 
        chronic basis and not treatable with a quick ten day course of 
        medicine.&nbsp; Patients need to understand clearly that they have a chronic 
        illness, and when you want to see them back.</font></span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow"><span lang="es">
</span></font>
        <span lang="EN-US"><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">(4)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">Vitamins:&nbsp; The patients are very concerned regarding vitamin 
        deficiencies, although I have rarely seen a clearcut case of vitamin 
        deficiency.&nbsp; Instead of dispensing a lot of vitamins, which are 
        expensive, I have tried to do more education of the balanced diet, and 
        have only given vitamins to pregnant women or to children with poor 
        growth.&nbsp; I have tried to avoid reinforcing this worry about vitamin 
        deficiencies by giving vitamins, except in clearcut cases where I have 
        seen actually vitamin deficiencies exist.&nbsp; Many local doctors use 
        Vitamin B shots (in the forms of Rojamin, Neurogime, Neurobion, Beco 5) 
        to cure a variety of illness to miscarriage, musculoskeletal pain, any 
        medical complaint.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our Clinic does carry the Vitamin B 
        shots, which does send a mixed message to patients, even though I have 
        NEVER prescribed these during my time here.&nbsp; It would be a goal to STOP 
        CARRYING VITAMIN B PRODUCTS IN OUR PHARMACY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please continue to argue 
        against Vitamin B in the pharmacy.</font></span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow"><span lang="es">

        <span lang="EN-US"><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">(5)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">Stopping Treatments Early:&nbsp; Because of their desire for a quick 
        fix, the patients are unsatisfied if the medicines do not work right 
        away.&nbsp; They are impatient to take a full course of medicine for 7 to 10 
        days, and will often take the treatment for a day or so before visiting 
        another doctor, who will most likely change your treatment.&nbsp; For this 
        reason, I try to reinforce the duration of treatment, and why it is 
        important to complete the treatment, and if the treatment does not work 
        well, make sure you tell them to come back.&nbsp; If they know that you want 
        to see them again, they will return instead of going to someone else.&nbsp; 
        Also, I try to give a clear idea of how many days they will need to get 
        better, and return precautions, symptoms or scenarios in which I will 
        worry that the treatment is not working well.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; “Your child 
        has a cold.&nbsp; His body will fight this over the course of 5-7 days.&nbsp; If 
        he has fever that lasts more than 3 days, vomiting with blood, pus 
        draining from his ear, is not drinking enough to produce one urine every 
        eight hours, or other worries, please come back right away.”&nbsp; (6)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">The patients always want some sort of medicine:&nbsp; This can be a 
        challenge, because the patients always feel that they must leave with 
        SOMETHING.&nbsp; So, for example, there are times when I do give medicine, if 
        just to keep them from going to another doctor who may give them 
        something completely useless, such as Vitamin B shots.&nbsp; If my giving a 
        child with a cold a cough syrup prevents them from going to another 
        doctor for a shot of penicillin, I err on the side of the cough syrup.&nbsp; 
        The PLACEBO EFFECT is huge, otherwise, I doubt there would be much use 
        for vitamin shots.&nbsp; (7)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font size="1" face="Arial Narrow">The patients like polypharmacy:&nbsp; Sometimes it is unavoidable…. 
        You have to give one person four or five medicines, but I try to stick 
        to a fewer number of medicines to avoid confusion.(8)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial Narrow"><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
        </span><font face="Arial Narrow"><font size="1">The patients share medicines:&nbsp;&nbsp; If one person uses a medicine 
        that helps them, they will share it with their neighbor or husband 
        whether or not they have discussed it with a doctor first.&nbsp; Just beware 
        that this occurs.</font><font size="2"><br>
