      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">During 
      a 13 day stay (March 5 to March 17, 2005) at Guadalupe Clinic I provided 
      anaesthesia for approximately 30 patients undergoing a variety of general 
      surgical procedures.&nbsp; I accompanied a Canadian surgeon, Dr. Dan Mahoney, 
      to the clinic to do this work.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">I 
      provided 19 spinal anaesthetics, 9 general anaesthetics and 2 local 
      anaesthetics with intravenous sedation.&nbsp; The commonest surgical procedures 
      performed were inguinal hernia repairs with mesh, umbilical hernia 
      repairs, and epigastric hernia repairs.&nbsp; In addition, several minor 
      plastic surgical procedures were completed (excision supernumerary breasts 
      bilateral axillae, excision large cheloids ear pinna, excision 
      granulomatous lesion ankle).&nbsp; A large parotid tumour was excised under 
      endotracheal general anaesthesia.&nbsp; An acute traumatic amputation of 4 
      fingers resulting from a mining accident was debrided and repaired under 
      general anaesthesia.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">No 
      major complications resulted from the anaesthesia and surgery provided.&nbsp; 
      One elderly male patient with pre-existing prostatic problems was unable 
      to void post-op following spinal anaesthesia for hernia repair.&nbsp; He 
      required overnight urinary bladder catheterization.&nbsp; The catheter was 
      removed the next morning by which time he was able to void freely and was 
      discharged.&nbsp; Several patients developed low grade fevers during the first 
      24 hours following surgery.&nbsp; Febrile patients were kept an extra day in 
      the post-op short stay area and received an extra day of intravenous 
      antibiotic medications following surgery.&nbsp; No overt post-op infections 
      were encountered.&nbsp; No other post-operative anaesthesia complications were 
      noted.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span lang="EN-US">
      PREOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION</span></b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Prior 
      to our arrival in South America, the Mission made a series of local radio 
      announcements about the visit by a surgical team to the clinic and invited 
      patients to attend.&nbsp; This seemed to be the best way to get the word out of 
      the new service.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">
      Preoperative patients were screened by the surgeon first.&nbsp; Those requiring 
      relatively low-risk procedures that could be performed either on an 
      outpatient basis or in a short stay unit (one or two nights maximum 
      overnight stay) were selected by the surgeon and slated into an upcoming 
      surgical schedule over the next 10 days.&nbsp; These patients were then 
      reviewed by myself for anaesthesia issues/risk and any preoperative 
      testing that might be needed (hemoglobin, BUN, creatinine, liver function 
      tests, urinalysis, glucose and do-it-yourself EKG all available at the 
      clinic).&nbsp; A modest knowledge of medical Spanish was essential for the 
      anaesthetist to review these patients (only one English/Spanish speaking 
      nurse was available to help with translations and she was needed most by 
      the surgeon).&nbsp; After assessment by the surgeon and by the anaesthetist, 
      patients were sent home with instructions to return on the day of surgery 
      with an empty stomach.&nbsp; They were asked to shower prior to coming to the 
      clinic on the day of surgery, and to arrive with a relative who was 
      willing to stay overnight with them at the Clinic (to feed and help care 
      for them postoperatively). </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span lang="EN-US">THE 
      DAY OF SURGERY</span></b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">
      Although outpatient surgery is quite feasible for most patients having 
      minor operations such as hernia repairs in Canada, this approach was not 
      reasonable at the Guadalupe Clinic.&nbsp; The Clinic is not road accessible and 
      therefore some patients had to walk long distances and catch several 
      buses, or ride a horse often for some hours to get back home after 
      surgery.&nbsp; Conditions at their homes were not ideal for outpatient safety 
      (no telephone, many hours from medical help, often no clean running 
      water).&nbsp; The alternative of having patients stay at a small hotel in the 
      nearby village of Guadalupe was considered, but the hotel was about half a 
      kilometer walk from the clinic (across a bridge over the river) and also 
      rooms in the hotel were up three flights of stairs which were too 
      difficult for the patients with recent hernia repairs to climb.&nbsp; </span>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">For 
      these reasons, all hernia repair patients were kept in the post-operative 
      recovery area for at least one night.&nbsp; This allowed us to monitor them for 
      fever or other problems, to provide them with analgesic medications, and 
      also to routinely provide several doses of post-op intravenous antibiotics 
      to prevent infection.&nbsp; The clinic hired a nurse to monitor the patients in 
      the recovery area over night and administer their medications.&nbsp; Most 
      patients were ready for discharge by the following morning.&nbsp; Those with 
      persistent low grade fever were kept on IV antibiotics for more than a 
      day.&nbsp; Hernia patients were discharged home with a small supply of 
      Acetaminophen with Codeine tablets and a short course of oral 
      antibiotics.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">The 
      one room Recovery Room was a busy and congested location.&nbsp; No meals are 
      provided by the Clinic to patients, so most patients brought a relative 
      with them to provide food, drink, and personal care.&nbsp; On arrival on the 
      day of surgery patients were assigned a bed in the Recovery Room and then 
      sent to the shower to scrub head to toe with a Proviodine (or 
      Chlorhexidine) surgical scrub package.&nbsp; They were provided with a clean 
      patient gown and an IV of 1 litre of Normal Saline was started.&nbsp; Although 
      7 beds were present in the Recovery Room, only 5 were accessible to 
      patients as the other 2 were jammed in corners (these were used by 
      sleeping relatives of patients at night).&nbsp; During the day there were 
      usually still some patients in beds from the previous days operations 
      (waiting for buses to ride home, or horses to arrive) and meanwhile a new 
      group of patients was arriving to get showered and gowned prior to the 
      current O.R. day.&nbsp; There is a single washroom with toilet and shower 
      available for all these patients and relatives.&nbsp; Male and female patients 
      all share the same room with little privacy, but seem used to such a set 
      up and appeared quite content and comfortable.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">The 
      operating room itself is a large clean room, quite new, with good overhead 
      lighting and a good mobile surgical spotlight mounted overhead.&nbsp; It has no 
      windows, which aids cleanliness, but consequently the room is not well 
      ventilated and tends to get hot and steamy.&nbsp; Power supply is reliable 
      because the Clinic has a back-up generator which can be started reliably 
      by the staff whenever there is a power failure (happens quite often).&nbsp; 
      Three fully functioning steam autoclave units are available next to the 
      operating room area for sterilizing equipment.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

      Equipment available to the anesthetist at the time of my visit is outlined

      placed a photocopied Specifications and Equipment guide and Instructions

      for future reference </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- the&nbsp; 
      Narcomed Compact is by North American Drager Company, 148B Quarry Road, 
      Telford, Pennsylvania. USA. 18969.&nbsp; This machine is Drager Ave Serial 
      #4886.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- 
      ventilator has a hanging bellows and the machine has a rate and volume 
      control to adjust minute ventilation.&nbsp; Volume adjustments are made 
      manually with a push-bar mechanism right on the bellows assembly.&nbsp;
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- a 
      technician from the nearby hospital in the town of Zamora checked over and 
      apparently serviced the anaesthesia machine a few weeks before our visit.&nbsp; 
      Obviously there is no one on site to service or maintain the machine 
      regularly and this is therefore the visiting anaesthetists 
      responsibility.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- at 
      the Clinic there are a number of sets of light weight plastic anaesthesia 
      circuit tubing for the circle&nbsp; system.&nbsp; There are about 7 of these sets 
      in adult size and one set of pediatric tubing.&nbsp; These are meant to be 
      disposable single use sets;&nbsp; however, we safely reused them repeatedly by 
      placing a small in-line disposable heat and moisture exchanging filter 
      between the circuit and the patient airway.&nbsp; The small filters were 
      discarded between each patient.&nbsp; A small supply of the filters were left 
      at the clinic, but any visiting anaesthetist should probably bring along 
      some new ones unless you plan to clean, disinfect and dry the circuit 
      hoses between each patient.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span lang="EN-US">2) 
      Oxygen Supply</span></b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- 
      there is no piped-in oxygen and no small back up oxygen tanks on the yolks 
      on the anaesthesia machine itself.&nbsp; All oxygen came from large stand alone 
      compressed oxygen tanks (44.8 kilogram tank size) which were lined up 
      along the wall in the operating theater.&nbsp; Six tanks were available at the 
      time we were there and had been brought in by truck especially for our 
      visit.&nbsp; We used up 2 tanks during our 8 days of surgery at the site.&nbsp; You 
      must connect the anaesthesia machine to one of these tanks (2 pressure 
      reduction valves with on-off hand turning valves and pressure guages and a 
      big wrench were available to connect the tanks up to the valve assemblies 
      and oxygen gas line going into the anaesthesia machine).&nbsp; Please note that 
      the oxygen pressure must be turned up higher than 28 on the oxygen tank 
      dial to have sufficient drive pressure to run the ventilator.&nbsp; Below that 
      pressure, the oxygen will flow through the circuit to the patient allowing 
      spontaneous breathing or hand bagging, but the ventilator will not 
      function.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- one 
      oxygen tank was moved to the Recovery Room area temporarily for one 
      patient who required oxygen for an hour postoperatively via nasal prongs.&nbsp; 
      Otherwise oxygen (and suction) are not available in the Recovery area so 
      all patients were kept in the operating room until awake and stable enough 
      to go to recovery without supplementary oxygen/suction needs.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- 
      there is no nitrous oxide available here presently and it was not needed 
      (it is rarely used now at the hospital where I work in Canada anyway).&nbsp; 
      The machine is set up to use nitrous oxide (has a flow meter and a nitrous 
      oxide intake line) should this gas be required in future.&nbsp; </span></font>

      Volatile Agents  Vapourizors</span></b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- the 
      anaestheia machine has two vapourizors for volatile agents.&nbsp; However as no 
      volatile agents were available at the clinic, and purchase price of these 
      agents is prohibitively high in Ecuador, I did not use any volatile agents 
      in my anaesthetics.&nbsp; I was unable to transport any volatile agents aboard 
      the aircraft when I flew to Ecuador as they are on a list of Dangerous 
      Goods that the airlines will not allow on board.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- the 
      vapourizors were both quite ancient but probably would work (I dont 
      believe they have been recently checked and calibrated however).&nbsp; They 
      work on the direct pour fill method (i.e. they do not fill with 
      pin-indexed colour-coded spigots like modern vapourizors.&nbsp; You just pour 
      the volatile liquid directly into a small open reservoir on the side of 
      the vapourizor and it runs down a trough into the tank inside the 
      vapourizor.&nbsp; This obviously leaves room for deadly error if the wrong 
      volatile agent is put into the vapourizor chamber).&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- 
      Halothane liquid and a Halothane vapourizor were available at the nearby 
      hospital in Zamora so it must be possible to obtain this volatile agent in 
      Ecuador.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">- 
      Vapourizor specifications were as follows:</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">
      Because no volatile anaesthesia agents were available, I chose to use 
      local, or regional (spinal) anaesthetics when possible, or Total 
      Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) using Propofol for my general 
      anaesthetics.&nbsp; The clinic happened to have a good stock of Propofol 1% 20 
      ml glass vials that I could use for this purpose (however, this may not 
      always be the case so check on availability of this drug at the time of 
      your visit, or plan to bring your own).&nbsp; There is not an infusion pump 
      available at the Clinic for giving TIVA so you should bring your own.&nbsp; I 
      borrowed a Bard Propofol Infusion pump for this purpose from my base 
      hospital in Canada and returned it to Canada at the end of my stay in 
      Ecuador.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pump is relatively small and portable and easily carried in 
      luggage.&nbsp; The anaesthesia machine was used just to ventilate patients with 
      100% oxygen while the anaesthesia agents were all administered 
      intravenously.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">If you 
      do manage to get volatile agents in the O.R. here in the future, be aware 
      that there is no gas scavenging system available and that ventilation of 
      the operating room is not great;&nbsp; therefore be prepared to be breathing 
      some fumes if you choose to give general anaesthetics with an inhaled

      drugs as these are often not there at all, or are in short supply.&nbsp; Many 
      of the drugs are now out-dated but for most uses, this probably doesnt 
      matter much.&nbsp; You should plan to bring most of what you need with you.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      This includes drugs (particularly muscle relaxants, neostigmine, 
      glycopyrrolate, midazolam, propofol) and specific disposable anaesthesia 
      equipment (spinal needles, endotracheal tubes, sterile gloves, any special 
      sized needles or syringes). .&nbsp; Muscle relaxants in particular are hard to 
      come by, expensive for the clinic, and out-date quickly so you should 
      bring lots with you.</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;The

      Disposable drapes, bloody sponges, body parts, etc. are incinerated in a 
      small outdoor incinerator.&nbsp; Pathological specimens are generally not sent 
      off for examination unless it is important to have a specific diagnosis.&nbsp; 
      We did send one tumour off to be examined, but apparently results are not 
      easily or reliably obtained.&nbsp; Specimens seem to go astray sometimes.&nbsp;

      stream of supplies, drugs, equipment, and personel from abroad.&nbsp; The local 
      people are friendly and appreciate the care provided.&nbsp; The surgery 
      provided at this Clinic is really filling a need for these people as there

procedure we did was hernia repairs (inguinal, umbilical, ventral, epigastric), 
often with mesh repairs.&nbsp; We also removed several parotid gland tumours, some 
lumps and bumps, incision and drainage abcesses, repair of a traumatic hand 
amputation, one full mouth dental extractions on a small child.&nbsp; The biggest 
cases we performed were this year when we did two open cholecystectomies (there 
is no laparoscope there).&nbsp;The gallbaldders were done under full general 
anaesthesia with narcotic, muscle relaxants, and IV Propofol infusion using an 
infusion pump.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did all the inguinal hernias, other than small children, 
&nbsp;under spinal anaesthesia.&nbsp; The small children I did under general anaesthesia 
using a Propofol infusion pump.&nbsp; The upper abdominal hernias were done under 
local anaestheisia with IV sedation&nbsp; (Versed or low dose Propofol infusion), or 
full general anaesthesia using Propofol infusion, intravenous narcotics and 
Rocuronium as a muscle relaxant where needed for the large hernias.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There are no 
inhaled agents available at the clinic.&nbsp; They have vaporizors on the anaesthesia 
machine but no volatile agents available.&nbsp; If you are able to bring some 
volatile agents with you (Forane, Ethrane) you could use these I presume, but I 
was unable to bring these agents aboard the airplane as they are on the list of 
dangerous/prohibited products for air transport.&nbsp; There is no nitrous oxide on 
the anaesthesia machine, and no air mix available.&nbsp; Therefore all general 
anaestheisa was done with 100% oxygen plus IV drugs.&nbsp; The oxygen comes in huge 
tanks bolted to the wall and is used not only for the patient to breathe, but 
also to drive the ventilator bellows.&nbsp; There is no gas scavenging system, but as 
there are no gases except oxygen, it really doesn't matter.&nbsp; If you look at the 
information I have posted on the web page from my visit last year you will have 
all the particulars on the gas machine and monitors that were available at that 
time.&nbsp; I left an instruction manual (photocopy obtained from the company)&nbsp;for 
the machine in the drawer of the anaesthesia machine.&nbsp; The clinic has since 
improved their monitoring capabilities and has two automatic blood pressure 
cuffs (although they are only &quot;automatic&quot; if you push the start button - they 
will not cycle every 3 minutes).&nbsp; They also have a new pulse oximeter which 
works quite well, two functioning EKG machines which will print out a strip or 
full cardiogram with interpretation,&nbsp;and also an EKG monitor on the anaesthesia 
machine itself.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">They have 
improved the physical space by installing a dehumidifier in the operating room 
which makes it much easier to work comfortably without dripping sweat on the 
patient wound, and also an exhaust fan in the sterilizer room which has cut the 
steaminess considerably.&nbsp; They also have installed curtains between the 6 
hospital beds in the overnight ward room so there is some privacy for the 
patients.&nbsp; The Clinic managed to provide a nurse to stay with the patients 
overnight although this was a bit of a challenge at times, with Amanda having to 
fill in a lot of the night shifts herself while still working all day as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We initially 
had planned to do outpatient surgery for the hernias, but on seeing the living 
conditions of many of the patients (living miles away up mountainsides, having 
to return home on horseback or hours on the bus, no clean running water or 
electricity in the homes, miles from any medical help in the case of any 
emergency), we decided to keep all the patients overnight at least one night.&nbsp; 
The gallbladder patients we did on a Friday so they could stay over the weekend 
and be discharged out by Monday morning to make room for Monday's incoming 
patients.&nbsp; We generally did 4 or 5 procedures per day and that kept the 
inpatient room full all the time.&nbsp; We ran IV fluids on all the patients for the 
first 12 hours or so to hydrate them and give a route for 3 doses of IV 
antibiotics (one intraop and then 2 further IV doses post-op).</span></p>

For the third year in a row I worked as a volunteer anaesthetist with a Canadian 
general surgeon (Dr. Dan Mahoney) at the Mission Clinic at Guadalupe, Ecuador. 
During our two week visit we completed approximately 35 major cases (requiring 
spinal or general anaesthesia and overnight admission) in additional to several 
minor outpatient procedures under local anaesthesia. Hernia repairs (inguinal, 
ventral, femoral and epigastric) were the commonest procedure done. A number of 
these were repaired with mesh. Several anal fistulas were repaired, and a number 
of lumps and masses were removed. One open cholecystectomy was completed at 
Guadalupe Clinic, and 5 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were done at the hospital 
in Zamora (public hospital located about one hour away by car) by our team. The 
oldest patient operated on was 83 and the youngest, a child of 4 years. No 
serious anaesthetic or surgical complications occurred, including no significant 
postoperative infections. With this third year of surgery, our team has 
completed over 100 general surgical procedures under anaesthesia at this 
location without any significant complications.<br>
<br>
<b>Anaesthesia equipment and methods</b> used were outlined in previous 
summaries of our visits to the Clinic. However, there were some significant 
improvements in equipment available this year. The anaesthesia machine is now 
equipped with a new monitor which records automatic blood pressure readings, 
pulse oximetry, pulse rate and continuous EKG. There is a second plug-in pulse 
oximeter and pulse monitor available should it be required in the post-op care 
unit, as well as a small battery operated mobile pulse oximeter for use by 
nursing staff in postoperative care. <br>
<br>
Another improvement is the <b>new piped in wall suction</b> available. The unit 
is run through a compressor on the roof of the clinic which provides suction to 
the dental rooms and also two separate suction lines to the operating room. One 
line can be used by the surgeon for intraoperative suctioning of blood or 
fluids. The second line can be connected directly to the canisters on the back 
of the anaesthesia machine to provide suction at the head of the bed for the 
anaesthetist. In addition, there is still an electrically driven suction with 
cleanable glass bottles which can be plugged in if required as a back up. A 
minor caution  the compressor on the roof tends to heat up a lot and therefore 
staff usually turn it off over lunch hour and late in the afternoon when the 
dentists are finished working. A reminder may be needed to the Clinic staff not 
to turn off the suction compressor while surgery/anaesthesia is ongoing in the 
operating room. <br>
<br>
<b>Anaesthesia and Surgery in Zamora Hospital</b></span><b> (which is NOT the 
Mission Clinic of Guadalupe)</b><span lang="en-gb"><br>
<br>
For the first time our team decided to do some surgery in the community hospital 
in Zamora (about an hour by car away). This was arranged because there were many 
patients requiring gallbladder surgery who would benefit from having 
laparoscopic rather than open cholecystectomy. The Zamora Hospital has a full 
set of laparoscopic equipment (CO2 insufflator, television monitor screen, 
laparoscopic camera and laparoscopic instruments) but unfortunately the surgeons 
at the hospital have not received training in use of these instruments yet, and 
therefore the equipment is not used. Also the Zamora Hospital was able to 
provide overnight nursing care for our patients. We successfully completed 5 
laparoscopic cholecystectomies at the Zamora Hospital. All patients were able to 
go home the day following surgery. We also elected to do one massive recurrent 
incisional hernia repair as an inpatient at the Zamora Hospital as this lady 
needed a prolonged inpatient admission following her surgery and this would have 
tied up our limited beds available at the Clinic.<br>
<br>
The anaesthesia equipment available at Zamora Hospital was in reasonable shape 
but a few cautions are needed. The anaesthesia machine is fairly modern, but the 
ventilator on the machine is broken. A technician apparently has already tried 
to fix it without success. Therefore it was necessary to manually bag the 
patients throughout the operations. This ties up the anaesthetist all the time, 
and for that reason it is preferable to bring along an anaesthesia assistant to 
do most of the manual bagging of the patients so that the anaesthetist is able 
to draw up drugs, change intravenous bags, etc. during the surgery. The machine 
has vapourizors for Sevoflurane and Halothane. I used the Sevoflurane as my 
primary anaesthetic agent for some of the cases and did the others using a 
Propofol infusion pump (which I brought with me  not available at the Zamora 
Hospital). There is no piped in oxygen. It is necessary to crank on the large 
tank of oxygen mounted on the wall of the room to turn on the oxygen source. 
There is no nitrous oxide or tanks of compressed air to mix with the oxygen, so 
all anaesthetics are given using 100% oxygen. They have an EKG monitor, 
automatic BP cuff, and oximeter, but the end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor and 
agent analyser were not working. Suction was fine.<br>
<br>
The electricity is not reliable. The power went off for some hours while we were 
there and a hospital back-up generator came on promptly enough. However, once 
the generator was on, we kept having trouble with the laparoscopic equipment and 
anaesthesia equipment cutting outas a result of the irregular power source 
coming from the generator. All the equipment was plugged in through surge 
protector boxes. These boxes kept causing all the electronic equipment to turn 
off in response to surges of power from the generator. In the end, we ended up 
taking the surge protectors out of some of the circuits and plugging the 
equipment directly into the wall outlets so that it didnt keep turning on and 
off in the middle of the operation.<br>
<br>
You should plan to bring all your own anaesthesia equipment and drugs with you 
to Zamora. This way you will be assured of having what you need, and it will 
certainly save the patient an expense. Otherwise you will have to go to the 
hospital store (part of the hospital, located near the Emergency Room) and buy 
each syringe, needle, IV bag, drug, endotracheal tube, IV administration set, 
bladder catheters, tape etc. from the store. This cost is usually charged to the 
patient if they are having surgery at the hospital. The store sells Sevoflurane 
and Halothane either in small plastic containers (about 30 mls) or by the 250 
ml. bottle (about $225 each). If you are operating on a number of patients it is 
much cheaper to buy a full bottle of inhaled agent and leave the unused portion 
at the Clinic for the next surgeon to use. If you are able to bring a bottle of 
Sevoflurane with you to Ecuador (not usually a permitted substance on aircraft 
however) this would certainly save the Clinic patients a big expense. If you are 
doing laparoscopic surgery, you need to bring your own surgical clips with you, 
or you can buy them in packs of 10 at the hospital store. Another caution  when 
we first visited the store we were told by the person in charge there that it 
was always open, so that if we needed anything in a hurry during the surgery, we 
could just send someone down to the store to get it. In fact, the next two times 
we went to the store there was no one there and it was locked up. Therefore it 
is likely a good idea to get all your equipment and drugs together before you 
start a case, because supplies may not be reliably available through the store 
when you suddenly need them.<br>
<br>
There is no recovery room. Patients must be well enough to go directly back to 
the ward following surgery, so you may wish to wait for awhile in the operating 
room with any patient who may have airway difficulties or be excessively drowsy. 
Oxygen prongs are generally available at the bedside on the ward if needed in 
the immediate post-op period, but monitoring is limited to pulse, blood pressure 
and temperature in the post-op ward. Each patient going to the ward 
postoperatively at the hospital must have their own supply of medications 
(narcotics, anti-emetics, pain pills, IV antibiotics, needles, syringes, alcohol 
swabs, dressings for dressing changes, IV bags, etc). Usually the patients keep 
these supplies in a drawer next to the bedside and the nurse administers them to 
the patient as directed in your physicians post-op orders. Another hint  write 
your post op orders in Spanish and use both the generic and the brand name of 
each drug to try to avoid problems for the nursing staff in following the 
post-op orders. It is best to leave an exact supply of each needle, syringe and 
medication required for the care of your patient in the bedside table and count 
out the supplies with the nurse and a relative if possible to make sure there is 
enough of each item. If you dont leave enough supplies, your patient just wont 
receive the medications you have ordered.<br>
<br>
Operating room staff at the Zamora Hospital were helpful and knowledgeable, even 
though they rarely have done laparoscopic surgery. Surgical instruments were 
chemically sterilized by the staff in Cidex and rinsed with sterile saline prior 
to use. Sterile cloth surgical drapes were provided. Several local surgeons were 
helpful in assisting at the operations. <br>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once again a 
  team from Canada consisting of Dr. Dan Mahoney (General Surgeon) and Dr. Susan 
  Bryan (Anaesthetist) plus three able helpers (Jeremy Bryan, Mike Bryan and 
  Zack Mahoney) provided general surgical services at the Clinic Hospital for a 
  period of 10 days.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Approximately 40 
  procedures were undertaken under general anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia, or 
  local anaesthesia with sedation. The most commonly completed surgeries were 
  hernia repairs (inguinal, femoral, umbilical and ventral).&nbsp; A variety of other 
  minor procedures included debridement and suture of a machete wound, removal 
  of gunshot pellets from an arm, removal of supernumerary fingers, and excision 
  of an olecranon bursa.&nbsp; No serious complications were encountered.&nbsp; Patients 
  having more major procedures such as hernia repairs stayed in a temporary ward 
  at the Clinic for one night following surgery.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There were a 
  number of improvements at the Clinic since our last visit a year ago.&nbsp; This 
  year we enjoyed cooler operating conditions in the O.R. theatre thanks to the 
  newly installed air conditioner.&nbsp; A larger new steam sterilizer was a great 
  help in preparing all the sterilized instrument trays required.&nbsp; We were 
  pleased to stay in the newly built family apartment complex located in the 
  nearby village.&nbsp; This was constructed by the Mission to provide comfortable 
  housing for visiting volunteers.</font></p>
