      Volunteer in Guadalupe, Zamora, Ecuador</span></font></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Not a 
      day goes by without at least one patient at the Clinica Nuestra Senora de 
      Guadalupe expressing their thanks for the services offered. What makes the 
      clinic unique is the quality of care, accessability of medications and the 
      affordability of the clinic for everyone. The clinic's current director, 
      Father George Nigsch, founded the clinic in the Southern part of the 
      country in the Amazon region where medical care is scarce. The patients 
      often travel half the night to attend the clinic or come the day before 
      and sleep outside the clinic doors. The population in this region is 
      pridominately Indigenous and the people are mainly subsistent farmers. The 
      predominately offers medical consults, dental care, lab tests, medicines, 
      surgeries, vision testing, eyeglasses, dentures and outreach programs.
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On a 
      daily basis the clinic is open for medical and dental care. The doctors 
      see anywhere from 30 to 100 patients a day. Thanks to the year long 
      efforts of the CMMB sponsored volunteer Beena Kamath the clinic now has 
      many patients with chronic diseases receiving regular checkups and long 
      term treatments. An Ecuadorian woman from Guadalupe does eye testing and 
      provides needed glasses thanks to the generosity of the donations of 
      eyeglasses from the Lion's Club. Dentures are also repaired and 
      manufactured at a simple dental lab the clinic sponsors. Most of the 
      population has lost various teeth by the age of 20 and have full dentures 
      before 40 years of age due to poor dental hygiene. The dentists and local 
      educators have started dental care education in the schools and 
      communites. </span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the 
      three years that I have been working at the clinic I have had the 
      privilege to met many generous volunteers.All of the medical and dental 
      staff are volunteers. Beena Kamath, a pediatrician from Denver Colorado, 
      and I have both been supported by CMMB. Many other volunteers from 
      Germany, Austria, Switzerland, England, Holland, Ireland, Canada and the 
      USA have all spent various amounts of time working at the clinic or in the 
      outreach programs. There is so much to learn from so many different 
      cultures and experiences.</span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">During 
      the year there are several groups of surgeons who come to offer very 
      economical surgeries for people who would otherwise not be able to afford 
      a surgery. The ophthalmogists visit twice a year offering 75 to 150 
      consults a day and performing about 50 cataract and tyrigium surgeries. 
      The ENT surgeon has performed over 80 operations primarily post-trauma 
      nasal deviations. We were fortunate to have the ENT surgeon present when a 
      local man was injured when a tree he was cutting down fell on him. The 
      surgeon was able to operate on him the following day when he arrived at 
      the clinic. Without the clinic he would have remained at home with a 
      crushed nose and lacerated forehead and no means to adequate medical care. 
      The general surgeon was able to do many hernia repairs as the work in the 
      fields starting at such an early age causes many such injuries. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
      clinic also helps sponsor two Medical Brigades twice a year. Nurses, Nurse 
      Practioners, Dentists and Physicians participate in the two week events. 
      The clinic helps transport the medication, supplies and personnel to 
      distant mining camps or other isolated communities for consults and 
      treatment. It is not uncommon to discover people who have never been seen 
      by a doctor before. One 34 year old man had frequent Epileptic seizures 
      since childhood and had never received medical care or medication. The 
      medical brigades offer consults, screening and medication to between 1200 
      to 1300 patients during the 10 day trip.</span></p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I have 
      seen so many people helped by the services offered at the clinic. One 
      elderly man had been almost totally blinded by bilateral cataracts that he 
      had suffered with for over 15 years. His grandson brought him to the 
      clinic leading him by the hand. Two weeks later, after the successful 
      surgery, the same man was able to return walking on his own without even 
      the need of a cane. Another 46 year old man came to the clinic with severe 
      bilateral hearing loss. After two surgeries he cried as he told us that he 
      had heard the church bells ring for the first time in twenty years. These 
      and so many other people helped in some way make me very thankful to be 
      able to be a part of the work at the Clinica Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe 
      due to the ongoing sponsorship I receive from CMMB.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">

<font size="2" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Medical 
Brigade - January 2006</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We had a 
group of 5 come from the USA to help us out during the Jornada and one doctor 
from the clinic came along.&nbsp; The ten of us (5 doctors, two nurses, two 
translators and a farmacy helper) left for&nbsp;an isolated mining town in the 
mountains.&nbsp; It was like an old time gold boom town from the old west.&nbsp; No 
plumbing, simple wooden shacks hastily thrown up in a hap-hazard arrangement.&nbsp; 
There used to be almost daily deaths in the mines from exlpotions going off 
premature or cave-ins.&nbsp; Now the young men make between $9 and $14 a day by 
carrying out on their backs 2000 pounds of wet rocks.&nbsp; 90% of the patients had 
lower back pain with good reason.&nbsp; It was a twenty minute climb up the steep 
hillside just to get to the meals.&nbsp; What a place.&nbsp; From there we went to a 
larger town and saw lots of people.&nbsp; The people had lots less depression in this 
second town.&nbsp; The third town was a small isolated community that has one bus 
each Sunday that arrives there. It was a really fantastic experience.&nbsp; The 
people divided into groups and supplied our meals.&nbsp; They were so generous with 
us and after the four meals they refused to accept any money!&nbsp; They even opened 
up a house for us to sleep in.&nbsp; The people were so generous and helpful&nbsp; There 
was no impatience or pushing in this wonderful community!&nbsp; Then we went to a 
community on the other side of a river where we floated across on a barge that 
is on a cable and uses the water flow to go from side to side of the river.&nbsp; 
From there we headed off to a completely different area and visited a Saraguro 
Indian community.&nbsp; The school we worked in had lots of projects going on for the 
students.&nbsp; They had honey production, fish ponds and lots of manual crafts being 
taught.&nbsp; It was nice to see so much extra learning available for the students.&nbsp; 
While we were there a young calf was brought in draped over the back of a 
horse.&nbsp; It had been killed by a swarm of bees biting it.&nbsp; They were going to 
scrape it clean then stuff it for the school.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; The doctors noticed 
how different the Indigenous population was.&nbsp; They seemed to the doctors much 
more stoic and slower to understand instructions but were very greatful for our 
help and presence.&nbsp; It turns out that there had been a recent Jornada there 
before that charged very excessively for the medicine so the people were 
hesitant to accept our help at first.&nbsp; From there we went to a larger town and 
saw about 130 people.&nbsp; Then in the afternoon we packed up and were brought to a 
large town to find at least 100 people waiting for us at 4pm.&nbsp; We ended up 
seeing over 80 people that night.&nbsp; We were then taken to a hotel for a great 
night`s rest.&nbsp; It was the&nbsp;second night &nbsp;I had seen a bed during the whole trip.&nbsp; 
I slept very, very well!&nbsp; At most of the places the people would bring us 
blankets to put on the floor to sleep on.&nbsp; The last day we were in a very large 
town and had over 230 people seen before the group had to leave for Quito at 
3pm.&nbsp; We sent some people away without being seen there were so many that came 
that last day.&nbsp; In all we saw over 1500 people and had such generous people 
helping us in all the towns.&nbsp; We were very well received in all of the places we 
visited and I believe we helped so many people.&nbsp; It was a great experience for 
all of us and a great priveledge to meet so many different people and see so 
many different towns.</span></p>
