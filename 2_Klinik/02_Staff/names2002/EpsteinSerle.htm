<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">We had the opportunity to be medical volunteers at the 
Mission Clinic in December, 2001. At that time we had no laboratory or radiology 
support but a small pharmacy with most classes of drugs represented. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The clinic was 
well organized with the Receptionist greeting patients, setting up charts and 
determining the order in which patient’s were seen. This same individual 
dispensed medications from the adjoining pharmacy.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There were 3 
examining rooms. Two rooms were adequately furnished, with an examining table, 
desk, chairs and basic equipment. An electrocardiograph machine was available 
with readable tracings if one used some imagination. Dental rooms were being 
built and a surgical suite being furnished.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The patients were 
exceedingly polite and appreciative of the care rendered. Although depression, 
musculoskeletal problems and parasitic infestations were common, all manner of 
pediatric and adult illnesses were seen. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Surprisingly, malaria, tuberculosis, and major injuries were 
rarely, if ever, seen. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although people 
were poor and for some growth and intellectual development were stunted, overt 
malnutrition was rare. For those who could afford it, laboratory, radiology and 
specialty care were 2 hours away.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The accommodations 
at the Mission were very comfortable with private rooms with showers and 
communal meals. We were treated as honored guests. The Parish Priest, Nuns and 
workers could not have possibly made our visit more pleasant. In the evenings, 
we visited the surrounding villages and were fortunate to participate in a local 
religious and secular festival.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although working 
with limited diagnostic and ancillatory support leads to misgivings about 
quality of care issues, I believe the opportunity to serve as volunteers in this 
setting was rewarding both for the health care provider and for the greater 
Community.</span></p>

<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We were at the 
Mission Clinic for one week in December 2001 when it opened. There is a local 
physician Dr. Jaime Ortiz who has been hired to attend once per week. There have 
been a stream of foreign dentists and last week 4 physicians from a city 3 hours 
away. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The clinic has 
examining rooms, 2 dental rooms complete with dental x-ray, a surgical suite 
including a scrub room and recovery, and a pharmacy. The surgical area is not 
yet functional. Although the pharmacy has limitations we were able to treat most 
of what we saw. The clinic may soon have a basic laboratory. There is x-ray, 
laboratory, and surgical services in a city (Loja) 2 hours away for the few who 
can afford it and when the road is passable.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The people were 
indiginous subsistance farmers with a few shopkeepers and miners. The gold mines 
are about one hour away. The oil companies are not in this particular region. 
There is malaria in the general area but little in the immediate vacinity. 
Similarly we did not see dengue or yellow fever. Mosquitos were present but not 
in great numbers. The water is not clean and that coupled with often the people 
sharing accomodations with their animals, giardia and worms were endemic. We saw 
some acute diarrhea and perhaps one person with typhoid fever. Many people had 
back pain (called kidney problems!) as well as depression, alcoholism, 
hypertension, and children with chronic ruptured tympanic membranes. We also saw 
all manner of other medical illness from dysfunctional vaginal bleeding to 
rheumatoid arthritis to parkinsonism to kidney stones. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Some access to birth control is available in the city. 
Remarkably some people of greater means came from the city to this jungle clinic 
for second opinion, records in hand. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Surgical supplies 
were present for suturing, draining, packing and casting, but analgesics and 
local anesthetics were deficient. Hopefully this has been rectified. The 
examining rooms are equipt but you may wish to bring a portable 
ophthalmoscope/otoscope as a backup as well as a glucometer, gloves, gel, and 
hemoccult cards.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The parish is 
clean and accommodations quite comfortable with our own rooms and hot shower. 
The Nuns supplied us with preboiled water to drink and hearty meals safe to eat. 
We even felt comfortable eating the salads served to us by them, usually not a 
good idea in this setting. The Padre is from Austria. He has done remarkable 
things for his people in a place where the church does the social service tasks 
that are usually the purvue of the government. The government gives vaccinations 
sporatically and thus far this is not being performed by the clinic but perhaps 
in the future. The village is in the high tropical jungle along the main trade 
route to the amazon in Ecuador. It is poor but beautiful. I suggest that you be 
up to date for dT, polio, hepatitis a+b, and obtain yellow fever vaccine. You 
will need malaria prophyllaxis. I suggest a book Handbook of Medicine in 
Developing Countries by Catherine Wolf M.D. and Dennis Palmer D.O. Although 
mainly geared to the hospital it has usefull information in table format.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The weather is 
most pleasant. It is about 75*F during the day, sometimes warmer, and 65*F at 
night, again sometimes warmer. It rains every day. I brought scrubs and a 
laboratory coat to work in and was most comfortable and felt adequately attired.
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">One has to be wary of 
crime in Quito or Guayaquil but I felt perfectly safe in Guadalupe, especially 
as a guest of the parish mission. The currency is the US dollar. It goes far in 
Ecuador. </span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
There is little to spend it on in the village. We did not have a chance to be 
tourists but the beauty of the surroundings and the reward of helping others who 
appreciated the effort more than made up for it. They could use an operating 
microscope. If you know of any institution who might be able to donate one that 
would be terrific. That way ENT and basic Ophthalmology could be performed. Many 
children have ruptured TM's and many adults have cataracts and pterygeums.</span></p>

<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Today I saw a 43 
year old woman, six months pregnant, afraid of her alcoholic husband who beats 
her. The next patient was her husband... A 4 year old girl presents with a 
draining fistula from her tibia with osteomyelitis and possible osteosarcoma. 
She does not cry. Her father cannot afford to take her to an orthopedist. At an 
average of 20 years complaint per person with vaginal discharge, all told, today 
I saw 200 years of vaginal discharge.<br>
<br>
I believe that here, unfortunately, family planning begins at menopause. Large 
families are common despite the poverty. This is because of lack of resources, 
fear of child mortality and tremendous peer pressure to marry young, often to 
separate from parents and in order to leave home. Depression is common. Being 
poor, working in the fields, gold mines, and jungle with little help for those 
unable to care for themselves (at any age) and with many mouths to feed with 
little food, does not lend to merriment. <br>
<br>
Yet people are appreciative and enduring, with a strength and at times grace 
that we would be unable to muster in less harsh circumstance. There is music, 
dance, and religious festivals. And all is not without humor: “Doctor, I have 
terrible headaches in the sun.” ...&quot;What make it better?&quot; ... “I wear my 
sombrero.” ... &quot;Then I suggest that you wear your sombrero&quot;... Many complain 
that their bones hurt when it is cold. However, we are in the Amazon! Yet many 
individuals have multiple problems that impact their quality of life and ability 
to work and subsist.<br>
<br>
Even though the medicine we practice may give us pause in terms of quality, the 
peasants have such tremendous problems, and so few places to turn for help, that 
our worst efforts become models of exceptional care. And the clinic that Padre 
has built could be placed in the middle of any city in the United States and not 
seem out of place. The people line up by the dozens to be seen. It is 10 o’clock 
at night and they are already showing up to be seen tomorrow. We just finished 
our day’s work. I will need to rest in order to have the energy and spirit to 
try to do, in my own way, GOD’s work”.</span></p>

Between us we saw about twenty patients each day. This was my third visit to the 
mission and clinic. That we were less busy than on previous occasions reflects 
the maturity of the health care facility. With almost continuous medical 
coverage there is less of a pent up and almost desperate need to be seen, 
allowing for a more comprehensive approach to care. In addition the small 
laboratory can perform blood counts with differential, urinalyses, skin 
scrapings, pregnancy tests, and vaginal smears. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">PAP smears can be sent to the local cancer hospital several 
hours away. Some access to commercial laboratory and radiology is now available 
within a couple of hours bus ride. The pharmacy is remarkably complete for such 
a remote facility. </span>

is knowledgeable of the local health care needs and resources. The reputation of 
the clinic draws patients from rural and urban locations hours away.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The pueblos are noticeably more prosperous. For many people 
cement walls have replaced porous wooden slats. In part this represents a 
largely successful attempt by the government to uplift the life of it's 
citizenry through a subsidy program for construction. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The struggle for 
sustenance remains the dominant theme of life, punctuated by song, dance, sport, 
and religious festivals. There is greater ability to educate about health

<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I am an internist 
in private practice in Madison Connecticut. I have&nbsp;an academic appointment at 
Yale University,&nbsp;bringing both medical students and&nbsp;graduate nursing&nbsp;students 
into the office. My wife Jana Siman is an APRN. We work as a team. It is 
difficult to volunteer when in a small practice. I helped to run a venue for the 
Special Olympics when they were in New Haven in 1995, as well as volunteering at 
the Primary Care Clinic at the Hospital of St. Raphael as a preceptor when I 
first opened&nbsp;my practice&nbsp;in 1983. Jana donated services to the poor visiting 
clinics in the Middle East and Brazil during a previous&nbsp;international business 
career. Over the years I was disappointed to find that as a&nbsp;primary&nbsp; care 
physician&nbsp;most international and even domestic venues wished you to attend for 
many weeks, months or even years at a time. This was impossible. In 2001 I was 
in the midst of arranging to volunteer in the Carribean. I met a patient in the 
office on a saturday afternoon. His father, Frank Glowski,&nbsp;accompanied him and 
told me a story of a former AFS (exchange student) from Austria, Georg Nigsch, 
who many years earlier had lived with him for both a year of high school and 
then seminary school. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">He 
had become a priest at a rural mission in the tropical highlands of Ecuador 
along the Peruvian border. He was building a medical clinic. Already an 
Ecuadorean doctor, Dr. Jaime Ortiz,&nbsp;had been attending intermittantly. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I decided to get 
in touch with&nbsp;Padre Jorge Nigsch&nbsp;in the Amazon, or as they say the Oriente. 
Sometimes he has telephones, so I sent him an e.mail. We planned to close the 
office for two weeks and go. Then came September 11. After some soul searching 
my wife and I decided to keep our plans. What better way to be embassadors for 
our country during a time of turmoil. Off we went in December 2001. In Ecuador 
there are few people with health insurance. In theory if you are pregnant or a 
child of five or younger there is universal access to care. Unfortunately the 
government clinics are poorly equipped and with few medications. There are 
private physicians with variable quality of training, particularly in rural 
regions. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The doctor 
often owns the pharmacy with incentive to prescibe, particularly injectables.
</span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition 
the fees charged are often beyond the reach of the poor peasants, the majority 
of those in the mountains and jungles. They use&nbsp;self remedies,&nbsp;shamans, lay 
midwives, even villagers who have taken upon themselves the business of suturing 
wounds, both for cultural reasons and economic necessity. The population is 
mainly indigenous peoples, small farmers, shop owners, and gold miners. Many 
speak primarily their Indian language. My wife and I are not Catholic. We knew 
minimal spanish and less tropical medicine. With naiveté and misgivings but 
anticipation we left to join the team of international medical volunteers at the 
mission clinic. To our surprise we were the first volunteers, and the only 
health care workers within many kilometers. The nearest hospital was at least 
one hour away, muddy roads permitting. We had translaters to help us. The 
pharmacy was extensive but with gaps in coverage. The medications were often 
labelled in german, a language&nbsp;in which&nbsp;fortunately my wife is fluent. Some of 
the drugs were unfamiliar. We broke open boxes and set up examining rooms, set 
up charts,&nbsp;and began to see the villagers.&nbsp;By the end of the week we were seeing 
about twenty patients daily. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The clinic has two fully 
equipped dental suites, and operating theater, three examing rooms, a pharmacy, 
laboratory, and a fully set up optometry facility. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After we returned 
home&nbsp;we set about using the internet to recruit doctors, nurse practitioners, 
and physician assistants. A German dentist, Dr. Eberhard Pierro,&nbsp;through a 
charitable organization began to attract dentists. Internists, pediatricians, 
ophthalmologists, and an otolarygnologists have attended. Dr. Scott Soloway, an 
ophthalmologist from Branford Connecticut brought a team to the facility. A 
dentist from Madison Connecticut, Dr. Alan Friedler, has worked at the clinic. I 
applied for a Robert Wood Johnson International Health&nbsp;Scholarship but was not 
accepted. Despite this, my wife has returned, my step daughter Molly Brady has 
visited twice, and I have served on another two occasions and will again in 
december 2004. Individuals,&nbsp;religious groups,&nbsp;and nongovernmental organizations 
have donated supplies and devices ranging from an operating microscope to 
semiautomated desktop chemistry analyzers. Thousands of eyeglasses have been 
donated by the Lions Club, coordinated by the Madison chapter. Remarkably in 
almost three years there has been less than one month without a dentist and less 
than six weeks without a primary care health care provider. There have been a 
few trainees&nbsp;including a senior Yale APRN student, Stephanie Motter,&nbsp;brought by 
me. Washington State University School of Nursing, led by Dr. Lorna 
Schumann,&nbsp;has contributed physicians, nurse practitioners and graduate nursing 
students to yearly mobile health clinics, traveling&nbsp;to even more underserved 
areas, an activity&nbsp;organized by the clinic. The facility is now averaging about 
forty patients daily, and when surgeons, dentists, and primary care physicians 
are present, up to two hundred, many camping out on the steps to be certain for 
a consultation. Among others, REMEDY, an organization based at Yale that donates 
recycled surgical supplies, and the American Medical Resource Foundation in 
Boston Massachusetts, have contributed supplies. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Medications have been locally 
purchased in Ecuador and donated from Europe.&nbsp;They have been&nbsp;given to me by 
pharmaceutical representatives who visit my office. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I have been able 
to in turn forward them to South America. The pharmacy in now remarkably 
complete. The laboratory can perform a variety of tests. A technician is soon to 
arrive from the United States to expand services and train local personnel.
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Radiology is available 
about one hour away, for those able to pay. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The fee for a 
consultation is one dollar, to see the dentists&nbsp;the charge&nbsp;is by the tooth.
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Cataract surgury is 
fifteen dollars. Medications are a few pennies to the pill. For this region 
these are significant sums, but less that twenty percent of that charged by the 
local physicians. For those truly unable to pay, services or produce can be 
bartered. But no service is free. It is thought that this gives some ownership 
to the health process, and a sense of pride. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There is education 
on sanitation and other health issues, including&nbsp;AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted diseases. And in this Catholic community, the church preaches 
respect for women and care of children, but in practical not abstract ways.
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Parasitic infestation 
such as ascariasis, giardiasis, amebiasis and bacterial infectious diarrhea, are 
common. At two thousand feet, with few mosquitos,&nbsp;malaria, yellow fever and 
dengue rare. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Tuberculosis is 
mainly referred to government facilities. Common illnesses are seen, such as 
depression, musculoskeletal ailments, diabetes, and hypertension. As a 
practicing internist and adult nurse practitioner we were actually well prepared 
for most of what we encountered, even among children.. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Severe surgical emergencies 
could be sent to the hospital, minor injuries cared for at the clinic. 
Vaccinations are given through the government health center. Thus far 
the&nbsp;provincial officials&nbsp;have cooperated, allowing Padre Nigsch to utilize in 
his medical building&nbsp;any provider licensed to practice in&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;own 
country. If desired, longer term volunteers can obtain malpractice through the 
Catholic Medical Missions Board in New York City. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Volunteers have 
come, or are scheduled to arrive, from the United States, Switzerland, Germany, 
Austria, Ireland, England, Scotland, and Canada. Many of these were recruited 
via the internet. The Albert Schweitzer Institute at Quinnipiac University is 
now exploring ways that college students can both be benefited by the experience 
and do creative developmental work for the community. This has been a remarkable 
and satisfying journey, but still with long term success uncertain. Please visit 
the website www.guadalupe-ec.org and explore the links. </span>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In November 2005 I 
had the privilege of returning to Guadalupe Ecuador for my fifth visit. I was 
accompanied by a senior student from the Yale School of Medicine,
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="AronsDara.htm">Ms. Dara Arons</a>. We flew from Quito to Catamayo. Then we took a taxi to Loja, 
where we were met by Pepe. A long time employee of Padre Jorge, he drove us 
across the Andes into Zamora-Chinchipe Province and the jungle road to the 
mission. The route is now paved much of the way, shortening the trip to two and 
one-half hours from the prior customary four.&nbsp; The pavement turned from concrete 
and the terrain increasingly severe but lush. We soon knew that we were 
approaching the Oriente as clouds began to drape the mountains. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">&nbsp;The Mission Clinic 
of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a truly remarkable oasis of modern medical care in a 
remote region. There have always been local physicians of various skills and 
moral turpitude, private, or fresh from local medical schools and assigned prior 
to residency training, to tend to the indigenous poor.&nbsp; With the providers 
unaffordable, inaccessible, or ill equipped and inadequately trained, the 
populace has turned to shamans and folk remedies, or self medicated with 
whatever drugs were available from the local pharmacies. Lisa Greenfeld, a Peace 
Corps worker stationed in this area from 1998 through 2000 recently contacted 
me. She was based mainly in Piuntza. She describes visiting the various 
communities and without medical training or experience, and using a lay book 
‘Where There Is No Doctor,’ she and her husband attempted to use local remedies 
to give health care to those otherwise going &nbsp;without. &nbsp;In addition the province 
and river valley, under the tutelage of Padre Jorge Nigsch, was only recently 
beginning the slow process of integration of remote villages and ethnic groups 
into a more cohesive civil as well as religious unit. A local physician, Dr. 
Jaime Ortiz would visit the church mission a few hours once weekly. In this 
environment Padre Jorge and Mother Superior Consuelo Carvajal chose to build a 
new health care facility, initially to be staffed by foreign volunteers.&nbsp; When I 
first arrived with my wife and APRN Jana Siman in 2001, the facility was still 
being constructed, provision of regular dental and medical care and surgeries a 
romantic dream of an Austrian Priest and Colombian Sister.&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
dental suites were just being finished, an operating room bereft of equipment, 
and a limited pharmacopoeia of German herbal and mainstream drugs.&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We stayed in the 
Casa de Encuentro, the residence hall of the religious community. The 
volunteers’ residence was a cleared lot above the church grounds. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">&nbsp;Dara and I arrived 
at the Mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
During our week we saw many patients of all ages with various primary care 
ailments. The daily work load ranged from ten to forty two persons for the 
medical doctors and about fifteen daily for the German dentists.&nbsp; Many of those 
seen now had charts, with documented histories. Some continued to follow up for 
their chronic ailments. Frequently, prescribed medications had been discontinued 
as personal supplies grew short, but with education and ongoing affordable 
access to health care providers, some of the clients are now continuing their 
medical regimen. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The pharmacy on 
premise has allowed, with some creativity, continuous care for chronic ailment, 
and almost universal ability to treat acute disease. &nbsp;For the last three years 
we have begun to see surgical and other volunteer specialists coming into 
jungle. I was fortunate this trip to witness such an event. </span>

and his team descended upon and invaded the clinic. Well planned and well 
executed, more than ninety people were seen by the surgeons and medical staff. 
In the afternoon and well into the night cataract and pterygeum procedures were 
performed, giving sight to the blind. At a surgical cost of about ten to fifteen 
dollars, not insignificant to these poor people, many were able to be cared for 
who otherwise would have needed several hundred dollars for similar operations.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

all was work for us. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">On slower days we 
were able to visit a hamlet and a pueblo. On one such excursion, accompanied by 
the Sisters, we participated in a local lesson and mass. Prior to this Dara had 
the experience of educating a couple about their child with Down’s syndrome, 
alleviating the guilt that added to the parent’s burden.</span></p>

lessons of the religious services are seldom that of saving souls. Never have I 
heard talk of fire and fury, but rather that the path to salvation lay through 
personal betterment and proper treatment of one’s children and neighbors, always 
with respect and compassion. This is expressed in concrete ways, never abstract. 
It applies equally to farmers, professionals, and politicians. The form and 
content of services combines European and Indian traditions. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black">Fiestas abound, giving color and celebration to a 
difficult subsistence existence in a harsh environment. As a Non-Christian I 
never miss the opportunity to participate in the cultural life of the village.

learned to make empanadas, as a guest in a private home. We had an adventuresome 
meal of tilapia, guinea pig and frog at a local restaurant.&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
Mostly we ate our largest meal lunchtime with the Padre and Nuns. Breakfast we 
made ourselves with breads, fruits and grains supplied to us. For dinner we 
joined the priest, prepared food ourselves, or made outside arrangements. </span>

<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Our 
week ended far too soon. As we left a new dentist from German and an 
Otolaryngologist from Maryland arrived. A family physician from Alaska was en 
route. Other doctors from Austria, The United States, and Canada are due to 
visit. Many other international healthcare workers have served, are scheduled, 
or are being solicited. </span></p>

Indigenous residents of southern Ecuador.&nbsp; </span></p>

local school.&nbsp; Many of the men&nbsp;suffer&nbsp;from cough and congestion from the 
dust&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;when&nbsp;blasting in the mines. </span></p>

After a night in Guadalupe,&nbsp;basking&nbsp;in the relative luxury&nbsp;of the Mission and 
Residencia, we traveled to Tutupali, a very remote Indian town. When the road 
ended we finished&nbsp;our&nbsp;trip&nbsp;by mule,&nbsp;initially straight down at a 45* angle on 
mud and stone. This frightening but beautiful ride brought us to a rugged small 
pueblo by a rushing clean mountain stream. Along the way we passed magnificent 
vistas, with trees&nbsp;sprouting&nbsp;purple buds. The pueblo&nbsp;of Tutupali thrives&nbsp;on an 
economy based upon horses and mules, and by cultivating banana, sugar cane, 
corn, and a variety of cracked wheat. Many of the villagers spoke </span>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Quichua</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">, 
and little Spanish. </span><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
local public health nurse, a middle aged Saraguro woman, translated for us.

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
After a day and one half of seeing patients, we mounted our mules to climb the 
mountain.&nbsp;Dr. Weiss Rivera&nbsp;slipped off of&nbsp;her mule, striking her head on a rock. 
Using dental antiseptic and&nbsp; available supplies,&nbsp;we sutured her 8 inch 
laceration. We immobilized her. The&nbsp;townsmen built a stretcher and, in turns, 
eight of the men carried her the two hours up the steep muddy slope. We were 
able to arrange an ambulance for the 9 hour drive to Loja.&nbsp;Dr. Connelly 
accompanied her. She ultimately did well. </span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
For the&nbsp;last three days&nbsp;of the Jornada I was the only physician. We went to a 
small village, Esperanza, seeing only a handful of villagers in the&nbsp;small church 
on a hill. We&nbsp;then&nbsp;journeyed to a larger town, Yacuambi, staying for two busy 
days. All told, we saw in one week 465 medical patients. One day I&nbsp;was 
to&nbsp;examine&nbsp;90 persons. All of this was possible with the able assistance of
<a href="AndersonAmy.htm">Amanda</a> and <a href="ArmijosClaudia.htm">Claudia</a>, 
who served as translators, and Karen and Yolanda, working the pharmacy and doing 
patient intake. Many patients had parasites, presumed helicobactor pylori 
associated peptic ulcer disease, respiratory problems, musculo-skeletal 
complaints, depression, chronic vaginitis, prostatitis, diabetes, and children 
with failure to thrive. Many&nbsp;infants had poor nutrition&nbsp;from excess sugar water 
replacing other lacking dietary components. We also&nbsp;detected congenital heart 
disease, various fractures, hypothyroid goiter, and a missed 
congenital&nbsp;dislocation&nbsp;of the hip in a now young teenager.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
<a href="WolmershaeuserSigrun.htm">Sigrun</a>, the dentist, came with us. </span>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">She saw truly advanced caries in 
young people, pulling more than 120 teeth. </font></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
During our visit to Yacuambi, presidential and provincial elections were held. 
Every citizen was required to vote. The ballots were guarded by armed soldiers. 
The conservative and leftist candidates garnered the greatest number of votes, 
but not a majority.&nbsp;There will soon be a run off election. Ideology does matter 
in this country, but how it will affect the rural regions is yet to be seen. At 
6 AM&nbsp;Sunday mass in Yacuambi&nbsp;the lesson taught was that&nbsp;there is an&nbsp;obligation 
for the wealthy to assist the poor. Dr. Weiss Rivera was extolled for making a 
great sacrifice in coming to Ecuador from the United States, and for her&nbsp;being 
willing to risk grave injury&nbsp;to&nbsp;care for&nbsp;the poor&nbsp;citizens of the Oriente.

After a brief night's stay back at the Mission, I rejoined the other doctors in 
Loja for our trip home, again via the road to Cuenca. Back at work in the 
USA,&nbsp;in the office, on house calls, and&nbsp;rounding in the hospital, I remain 
fatigued, but energized by the experience. We were at remote, poor, at times 
stunningly beautiful locations. My companion physicians, Amanda, Sigrun,&nbsp;Karen, 
Claudia, Yolanda, and other personnel, were wonderful to live and work with. We 
were in truly remote high and low altitude venues, and carrying our supplies 
were able to effectively treat most of what we encountered. There was clearly 
danger, but under difficult conditions we rallied in a crisis, and continued our 
mission. </span></p>

<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I returned to 
Guadalupe September 29 though October 7. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">For one week I worked at the 
Clinica Misional. Padre Jorge had advertised my coming. </span>
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This, and the 
growing reputation of the health care center, ensured a significant turnout of 
patients. Up to 55 were seen in a day, averaging 40 persons. The clinic has an 
ultrasound for those able to use it, a well equipped laboratory comprised of a 
variety of chemistries and quick tests, an electrocardiograph, a large pharmacy 
with most classes of medications available, and almost full dental services. 
Specialists ranging from Plastic Surgeons to Gynecologists, 
Otolaryngologists,&nbsp;and Ophthalmologists, are scheduled to arrive in the coming 
months. We have an incomplete&nbsp;but growing network of local surgeons and 
specialists to which we can refer. </span>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I saw the usual variety of 
parasitic infestations, rashes, musculoskeletal problems, depression, metabolic 
syndrome, occasional asthma and other maladies.&nbsp;Also presenting de novo 
were&nbsp;probable uteran and testicular cancer, and congenital heart disease. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The 
problems of the health center are a function of its success. We needed to turn 
away several individuals each day in order to give adequate care to the rest. 
Amidst the poor and underserved, at least a dozen of whom had never before 
visited a physician, were the middle class and well to do from Zamora and Loja. 
I would treat a poor farmer for worms, an abandonned single mother for 
depression, and then give a second opinion to a young woman being treated in 
Cuenca for Lupus Erythromatosis. It is difficult to do a means test for those 
who come, so all are seen. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite this, the 
humanitarian mission remains strong. While I was attending at the main facility, 
the&nbsp;other doctors, along with nurse practitioners and dentists,&nbsp;were on a 
Jornada Medic</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">a</span><span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
to remote villages reachable solely by canoe. Although there may be issues of 
continuity of care, illnesses were identified, health education promoted, and 
some treatment given, to the hundreds of children identified by local church and 
government organizations. For a brief time&nbsp;these isolated Indiginous people&nbsp;came 
to know that they were not forgotten. The conditions of travel&nbsp;were&nbsp;difficult, 
the surroundings rustic, but the volunteers&nbsp;were&nbsp;welcomed as graciously as 
possible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="DE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The region is 
beautiful&nbsp;but poor. One can swim in a clean mountain stream or hike in the 
jungle. There remain some wildlife. A tiger like&nbsp;large cat&nbsp;was hunted for food. 
It was&nbsp;brought to us to appreciate. </span></p>

river. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Attending&nbsp;church 
service&nbsp;is as much a cultural as religious experience. The homilie gives 
practical lessons in coexistence and good public and private governance.&nbsp;As we 
turn to each other to wish peace, la paz,&nbsp;we descend from our vaulted place as 
guest foreign physicians&nbsp;and&nbsp;replace this&nbsp;with an awareness&nbsp;of comradery 
and&nbsp;commonality. </span></p>
