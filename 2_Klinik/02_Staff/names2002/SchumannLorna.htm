  <b><font face="Arial" size="2">Medical Brigade in March 2004</font></b><blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The beauty of Ecuador and 
      the Ecuadorian people is impressive. The team had an amazing and 
      successful adventure. The medical mission team arrived in Quito Sunday the 
      14th day of March, with plans to overnight in Quito and travel by plane 
      the next morning to Catamayo and Loja for a 5-hour bus ride to El Pangui, 
      located in a remote area of the Amazon basin. These plans changed suddenly 
      as we went to pick up our airline tickets and were asked if we could fly 
      in an hour, as space was available. Tame airlines waved the fee for the 
      transport of the medications (12 large duffle bags), saving us a sizable 
      amount of money. The change in plans worked out great and we had a restful 
      nights sleep in Loja before joining our two translators and Padre Jorge 
      Nigsch at the bus station the next morning.<br>
      The plans changed again when we arrived in El Pangui. Time had been set 
      aside for orientation and setting up the pharmacy. However, when we 
      arrived at 3:30 PM, patients were lined up to be seen. We organized in 
      half an hour and saw patients in the high school classrooms. The first two 
      nights we slept on mats placed on the classroom floor. The mats were 
      provided by the military and very comfortable. We arose early the next 
      morning and visited an orchid farm and then worked for 16 hours seeing 
      patients. We saw a wide variety of disease processes, including textbook 
      cases of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism that were at advanced stages. 
      We also saw some very unusual cases, like the man who had been bitten by a 
      poisonous snake several years ago and he had a large (golfball size) 
      lesion on the top of his right hand proximal to the bite. We continued to 
      see patients in El Pangui the following day, but were unable to see all 
      the patients who wanted to be seen.<br>
      In the evening, we traveled to Los Encuentros to see patients for 2 days. 
      Beena Kamath, a pediatrician from Denver, joined us in Los Encuentros. 
      Because she has been working at the Guadalupe Clinic for the last 10 
      months, her input on local diseases and pediatric problems was invaluable. 
      The Ecuadorian military worked with us to provide crowd control and take 
      blood pressures and pulse rates. They were very supportive and helpful. 
      After 2 days in Los Encentros, we traveled to Paquisha (a great place) to 
      see patients for 2 days. At Paquisha, we did a home visit on a 72-year old 
      man who was dying of cancer. He had a huge lymphatic tumor in his right 
      axillary area. The tumor and arm were infected, requiring dressing changes 
      every one to two hours. The dressings supplied by Heart-To-Heart were 
      invaluable to his treatment. We were able to treat the pain and infection 
      with the medicines supplied by Heart-To-Heart. By the time we left 
      Paquisha, 4 days later, he was doing much better. <br>
      While we were in Paquisha, several of the US and Ecuadorian team members 
      became ill. The medications supplied by Heart-to-Heart were very 
      appreciated by all of us.<br>
      On Monday of our second week, we took a day trip to Chinapintza, a gold 
      mining community. We saw a great deal of physical and emotional abuse in 
      this area. Many of the patients were very sick and had multiple health 
      problems. The day ended with a tour of two gold mines. It was an 
      eye-opener to the difficulty of the work the men endure. Our final day of 
      seeing patients was spent in El Dorado, a sugar cane region. <br>
      Thanks to all of you at Heart-to-Heart International, we were able to 
      provide treatments and medications to over 1300 people in remote areas of 
      the Amazon basin of Ecuador. There are not words that can fully express 
      the thankfulness of the Ecuadorian people for the gift of medications you 
      gave to them. Thank you for making this medical mission a very successful 
      project. The people at Clinica de Guadalupe also expressed their 
      appreciation for the generosity of you and your donors.<br>
      Respectfully submitted, <br>
      <br>
