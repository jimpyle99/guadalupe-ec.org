          Primary care health care workers including physicians and advanced 
          nurse practitioners, and dentists, are needed to help see the 
          indigenous population that is served by this modern clinic in the 
          Ecuadorian tropical highland along the Peruvian border. There is also 
          a need for ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, and 
          general surgeons in the near future when the operating room is fully 
          functional. The clinic is situated at a Catholic mission in the 
          village of Guadalupe along the main trade route into the Amazon. The 
          nearest hospital is several hours away. The clinic has examining 
          rooms, an operating room, and dental rooms with dental x-ray. There is 
          a well stocked pharmacy. There is a rudimentary laboratory. Some 
          access to commercial laboratory and radiology is available. A local 
          physician works part time as well as occasional foreign personnel. 
          Volunteers can come for as little as one week or for several months. 
          Travel is not reimbursed but room and board is covered with 
          comfortable accommodations at the mission. A knowledge of Spanish and 
          respect for religion is essential. </font> </p>

          </u>I am an Internist and have had the opportunity to volunteer in 
          Guadalupe Ecuador on two occasions. The clinic is remarkable with 
          examining rooms, a fairly complete pharmacy, and a broad range of 
          medical and surgical supplies as well as fully equipped dental rooms 
          with dental x-ray. The EKG machine could be better... There is a 
          rudimentary laboratory but no general radiology, although both are 
          available in the community. There is a surgical suite with scrub and 
          recovery area. As noted by P. Jorge the various anesthesia and 
          monitoring equipment has yet to be tested. A plastic surgery group is 
          considering visiting to set up the suite and return to perform cleft 
          palate and other procedures, but a firm date is not set. An operating 
          microscope is on route, and several German ophthalmologists are 
          planning to come within the year to perform cataract and pterygeum 
          procedures. If you were to volunteer at the clinic you could perform a 
          great service the first few days helping to organize the operating 
          room, testing what is available and guiding P. Jorge and the full time 
          nurse Amanda Anderson in obtaining necessary supplies and equipment 
          and instruments in order to make the facility functional. Perhaps P. 
          Jorge could arrange for a local anesthesiologist to overlap your visit 
          to help in this task and, if feasible, help you in performing hernia 
          or other procedures that could be done under local anesthesia with 
          sedation. Your visit would be well publicized so that patients are 
          lined up for you, perhaps prescreened by a general practitioner. You 
          may have to initially use better surgical instruments brought by you, 
          even though basics such as clamps, retractors, pickups, needle 
          holders, and various scissors are there, of varying quality. Two 
          autoclaves are present and used by the dentists. Although there is a 
          steady, but interrupted, stream of medical volunteers, should you wish 
          it there would also be ample general medical care to be provided to 
          the indigenous people of the region. However your main role would be 
          to help set up the clinic for general surgery for the future, with any 
          procedures you perform a bonus.....</font></p>

          a mission in the Oriente region along the Peruvian border. It serves a 
          local indiginous population of 3,ooo but in turn draws from a wider 
          provincial population of about 30,000. The clinic has examining rooms, 
          two dental suites, an operating theater, and an opthalmology/optometry 
          suite. A rather complete pharmacy is on premise. There is a laboratory 
          currently performing cbc, fungal and gram stains, pregnancy tests, 
          vaginal smears, stool parasites, and urinalyses. There is an 
          arrangement for PAP smears to be read at a regional cancer hospital. 
          Some commercial chemistry measurement is available at a laboratory 
          about 2 hours bus ride away. <br>
          The patients suffer from a variety of illnesses but this includes 
          diabetes and heart disease. It would be of great use to be able to 
          assess lipid profiles in this setting. There are medications in stock 
          to intervene and manage dyslipidemias....&quot; <br>
