          leaves much to be desired. The health insurances are in the hands of 
          the government, and therefore, extremely deficient. Many families are 
          not insured at all. So one could say, &quot;Only the ones who have money 
          can afford to get sick in Ecuador.&quot; Because of this situation, an 
          important part of our pastoral work consists of helping the sick. This 
          way we are also following the gospel of Jesus Christ, who was greatly 
          concerned for the poor and the sick. He healed their body and soul.</font></p>

          years ago when we had a doctor who visited us once a week in the 
          Mission of Guadalupe. Dr. Jaime Ortiz came from the neighboring town 
          called Zumbi to minister to our people weekly on Fridays. He continues

          Vorarlberg, Austria, Prälat Albert Holenstein, who is also the pastor 
          of St.Kolumban in Bregenz, Vorarlberg, annually sends us medicines. We 
          distribute these medicines at a very low price to the poor in our 
          primitive &quot;Consultorio Médico&quot;, which is no more than one of our small 
          bedrooms in the Mission of Guadalupe.</font></p>

          little, became a dream of the mother superior, Sister Consuelo 
          Carvajal C., of P. Jorge Nigsch and many parishioners. So, after 
          several years of thinking and planing, we decided to make our dream 
          come true. Father Albert Holenstein from St. Kolumban in Bregenz, 
          Austria said that he would give us a hand financially to build the new 
          clinic with funds from the Pontifical Mission Works of the Dioceses of 
          Feldkirch.</font></p>

          A young architect from Loja in the highlands of Ecuador, Carlos 
          Espejo, helped us with his ideas to make an excellent plan, and in May 
          2000, we began with the construction. In numerous mingas, which are 
          gatherings of volunteer workers from all the villages of La Paz and of 
          Guadalupe, the people helped and took ownership for this project.<!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;<br>
