      Province is home to about 90,000 individuals and abuts other Andean 
      provinces of similar size. Most people in this agrarian region are 
      indigenous, being Shuar, Saraguro or mixed heritage Indian/Spanish. The 
      majority of the citizens live in rural villages and some larger towns 
      which serve as trade, political, and religious centers. The vast majority 
      of the people are subsistence farmers, miners, and small shopkeepers.</span></font></p>

      <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">The government 
      has placed poorly supplied and staffed health centers in most of the 
      larger villages. They perform vaccination drives, and provide family 
      planning services, and some child and maternal care. There are some 
      private physicians for those who can afford them. A few regional hospitals 
      are present.&nbsp; Some have out patient services. The quality of care is 
      variable and in general not the same standard available in the large urban 
      centers along the coast and in the high Andean plateau in the north of the 
      country. The result is that most of the people do not have consistent 
      access to quality medical providers. </span></font></p>

      <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">Padre Jorge 
      Nigsch is the parish priest at an important Catholic mission along the 
      main trade route into the Ecuadorian Andean cloud forest zone, known by 
      them as either the Oriente or Amazonian part of the country. This mission 
      was already a center of religious activity and teaching for the province 
      when he opened a medical facility in October of 2001. The building 
      eventually, over time, was to house examining rooms, dental suites, an 
      operating theater, a pharmacy, and a laboratory. The first foreign 
      physician volunteer arrived in December 2001. He and his accompanying 
      nurse practitioner proceeded to set up the examining rooms, sort through 
      stacked boxes of donated (and often non-functional or inappropriate) 
      equipment and supplies, and proceeded to see patients. They set up charts, 
      and reviewed the pharmacy inventory. Many drugs were from Europe from a 
      mass donation, often not useable in this setting. The operating room had a 
      table and old anesthesia machines and monitors. There were no other 
      volunteers scheduled.</span></font></p>

      <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">Subsequently 
      several tasks needed to be accomplished to assist the Clinica Misional to 
      succeed. The first project was to recruit more medical volunteers, 
      initially for primary care then surgical and subspecialty care. This was 
      done by listing the venue on a variety of web sites, sending faxes and 
      letters to organizations, and talking with colleagues. Padre was 
      encouraged to establish an “experience” section on the mission clinic web 
      site as well as standards to be followed when soliciting personnel. 
      Success has been measurable in that from January 200</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">2</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy"> 
      through this time there have been only two months without a primary care 
      physician, and general surgeons, ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, 
      gynecologists, anesthesiologists, and gastroenterologists have visited 
      this venue. The next task was to locate an operating microscope, have the 
      company discount it, and have a donor subsidize its purchase and transport 
      to the facility. This has allowed a variety of surgical procedures to be 
      performed including cataract implants and tympanic membrane 
      reconstructions. Optometric equipment was donated, and the Lions 
      International has forwarded thousands of recycled eyeglasses to be 
      distributed. To supplement the pharmacy pharmaceutical company 
      representatives donated large amounts of medication that supplemented 
      purchased drugs. In turn these were mailed to Ecuador. In the first four 
      years this surpassed the donations from Austria and Germany that had been 
      the mainstay of supply until finally the clinic was certified to receive 
      discounted medicines from international relief organizations. A donated 
      new electrocardiograph was brought down. About two years later a 
      laboratory was set up, enabled by the generosity of many individuals. This 
      included centrifuges, semi-automated desk top chemistry analyzer, a QBC 
      blood count machine, two laboratory microscopes, a lipid meter, and an 
      assortment of supplies and reagents. A laboratory technician was recruited 
      to further establish procedures and explore avenues of restocking 
      material. Periodically solicited donations of replacement equipment have 
      been required to keep the machines in working order. Although not as 
      complete as one would wish, already some laboratory services surpass that 
      available in the regional capital Zamora one hour away. Dental x-rays had 
      been available, but all other radiographic services required a trip to 
      Zamora, and were often unaffordable. Initially they utilized an 
      obstetrical doppler, but in 2006 a complete portable ultrasound unit was 
      sent. This machine is capable of both vascular and visceral studies. Since 
      having been set up in October, it has been used on an almost daily basis. 
      General radiology remains beyond the scope of this rural facility. </span>

      <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">In the first 
      four years of existence through 2005 this remote health center had more 
      than 25,000 patient visits. In addition to surgical specialty care, out 
      reach is now being done to even more distant, isolated, or underserved 
      locations via mobile health fairs. In October 2006 three American 
      physicians and a German dentist, accompanied by an Ecuadorian translator, 
      an American nurse, and a Colombian medical assistant, participated in such 
      an event for one week. They visited a gold mining town high in the Andes 
      and a remote village reachable only by mule deep in a valley. They saw 465 
      medical patients in addition to giving adjuvant dental services, including 
      extraction of 120 severely rotted teeth. In November 2006 a group of 
      American nurse practitioners and Emergency Physicians, with Ecuadorian 
      civilian and military support, are providing gynecological services to 
      remote villages only reachable by motorized canoe. Each of these mobile 
      health clinics is within one to two days travel from the main facility in 
      Guadalupe, allowing continuity of care. In addition the villagers can be 
      assured that another such mission will arrive every three to four months, 
      organized by the Clinica Misional.</span></font></p>
