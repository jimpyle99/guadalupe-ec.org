      <font size="2" face="Arial">As a Christmas present it may have arrived a 
      little late. But on March 4<sup>th</sup>, 2004 at the Catholic mission and 
      clinic of Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Zamora, Ecuador, the arrival of nine 
      boxes of eyeglasses from the Madison Lions Club, must have been a welcome 
      present.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial">
      <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Lions of Madison, it started in 
      September, 2003, when Richard Borner, an active Lion and former president 
      of the local club, visited his doctor, Serle Epstein, in Madison. </font>
      <span lang="DE-AT" style="color: black"><font size="2">Dr. Epstein, 
      Madison physician, and his wife, Jana Siman, have been volunteering at the 
      mission in Ecuador </font></span><span style="color: black">
      <font size="2">since their first visit and first seeing patients in 
      December 2001 in Guadalupe,</font></span><font size="2"> a village in the 
      Ecuadorian Highlands near the headwaters of the Amazon River</font><span style="color: black"><font size="2">.</font></span><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
      </font></span><font size="2">Mr. Borner saw a few notices on the doctor’s 
      bulletin board with information about the far away clinic, and asked the 
      doctor if there was anything the Madison Lions could do to help. Dr. 
      Epstein noted the current need was for eyeglasses.</font></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Lions Clubs the world over 
      have long been active in the vision field, helping and funding eye 
      research as well as providing eyeglasses for needy, this project seemed 
      just the thing. Mr. Borner learned that used eyeglasses collected in 
      Madison and elsewhere are recycled for use again, first to the 
      LensCrafters shop in Old Saybrook and then at a recycling center in New 
      Jersey. He contacted the Lions eyeglass center and was offered not just 
      the 1,000 or so eyeglasses he asked for, but a total of 1,655 eyeglasses.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas Eve Mr. Borner 
      visited the New Jersey center and picked up nine boxes of eyeglasses. On 
      Friday, January 9, he posted the 9 boxes to Zamora, Ecuador, for the use 
      by the some 30,000 indigents who reside within the jungle area served by 
      the Guadalupe clinic. All the Lions waited patiently for weeks to hear 
      word of the arrival of the eyeglasses. Finally, on March 4, the following 
      message came in from Padre Jorge: </font></p>

      <font size="2" face="Arial">I am just amazed how blessed we are here in 
      Guadalupe. The last three weeks we had German eye doctors here who made 
      many eye operations and prescribed many glasses so that we ran out of the 
      most common ones. Now, the first week of May, a Dr. Scott Soloway from 
      Connecticut will come, also to do eye surgeries. So it will be a great 
      help to have your glasses. </font></span></p>

      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While most vision projects by the 
      Lions Clubs are organized on a national or world-wide basis, the Madison 
      Lions Club was able to organize what is hoped is just the first of many 
      activities on behalf of the far away clinic, mainly because of Mr. 
      Borner’s notice of his doctor’s bulletin board, and because of Dr. 
      Epstein’s personal involvement with the clinic. As word went out about the 
      Lions’ initiative to ship the eyeglasses,&nbsp; several local church 
      organizations including Temple Beth Tikvah and the First Congregational 
      Church provided financial assistance to help defray the $600.00 cost of 
      shipping the 9 boxes. It is hoped that this will be just the first of a 
      continuous supply of eyeglasses for the men, women, and children who visit 
      the clinic at the Mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Borner noted that the Lions Clubs 
      throughout the world are committed to helping with vision needs. Heeding 
      Helen Keller’s 1925 challenge to be Knights of the Blind, Lions have 
      placed special emphasis on sight conservation and blindness. Recycling 
      used eyeglasses is a major goal of Lions and for the Madison Lions Club, 
      this has been a particularly important project. Lion David Longobucco, 
      past president of the club, has for many years collected eyeglasses placed 
      in collection boxes throughout the town, historically located at banks, 
      and soon at other convenient drop-off points. Donors who for years have 
      dropped off their discarded spectacles, now, because the eyeglasses 
      actually got to the Mission Guadalupe, have real proof that one small 
      gesture of generosity goes a long way.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">Move forward to 2008 and the Madison Lions now 
      have shipped in excess of 15,000 eyeglasses to the Mission Clinic in 
      Ecuador and more than 6,000 eyeglasses to a clinic the Dominican Republic. 
      In September, 2006, Madison resident, Dr. Meg Weiss-Rivera, returned from 
      a volunteer mission to Ecuador having seen the wonderful response to the 
      eyeglasses at the Guadalupe clinic, approached the Madison Lions with a 
      request that eyeglasses be donated to a needy local clinic in Santo 
      Domingo, capitol of the Dominican Republic. Over the course of the last 15 
      months, over 6,744 eyeglasses have been shipped to the clinic taken either 
      by curriers or by various shipping vendors. </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">In order to continue to fulfill the need for 
      eyeglasses in these needy clinics, the Madison Lions have set up 
      eyeglasses collection boxes not only throughout the town of Madison at 
      various banks, but the club has established eyeglass collection centers in 
      a number of statewide locations including Pfizer Research and Development 
      buildings as well as the Connecticut Departments of Public Health, 
      Children and Families, and Mental Health and Addiction Services. Donations 
      of all kinds of eyeglasses, including readers, bifocals, and sunglasses 
      are gratefully accepted.</font></p>
