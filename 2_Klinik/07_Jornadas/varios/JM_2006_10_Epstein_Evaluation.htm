        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">As it 
        currently stands, a Jornada,&nbsp;from a medical provider&nbsp;point of view, is 
        very busy but much easier to run, focussed upon chief complaints rather 
        than chronic illness and preventative care. This however is suboptimal. 
        Ideally we would do much more of the practice of longitudinal care for 
        chronic illness. Hopefully time would also be made for education 
        services. This would entail charting, more regular visits to the 
        pueblos, and either bringing more medications with us or 
        promoting&nbsp;travel to the pharmacy&nbsp;in Guadalupe. As we do more, we 
        would&nbsp;see fewer patients per health care provider. They would need more 
        time.&nbsp;I think any venue&nbsp;greater than&nbsp;one day's travel away should be 
        visited at least quarterly, and more effort&nbsp;should be made to have 
        inclusion of the local health care personnel, particularly the 
        government health center workers. It would be great if we could have 
        Jornada Medicas every 3-4 months, on a regular circuit to underserved 
        villages, and with a predictable amount of resources. We would need to 
        recruit more personnel, perhaps utilizing academics or students&nbsp;as well 
        as private practitioners. We would also need to either have a ready 
        source of medications, or more efficiently, donate money to the clinic 
        periodically for this purpose. They can buy discounted pharmaceuticals. 
        We now have a foundation <em><span style="font-family: Arial">
