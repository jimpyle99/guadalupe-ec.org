        &nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">I have to say these were an 
        exciting five weeks, not only with the medical work but also with the 
        entire team here at the Clinic. We enjoyed camaraderie and weekend 
        cookouts galore. </font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The Mission Clinic serves a large 
        rural population. From the city of Loja four-hour bus ride away up into 
        the mountains. Patients come the night before and literally sleep on the 
        front steps of the Clinic in order to be first in line the next morning.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The Clinic and the doctors’ 
        quarters were built recently and are very nice even to “first world” 
        standards. Unique electrically heated showerheads, computer with 
        internet access, TV with a video movie collection and a large kitchen to 
        cook to one’s heart’s desire complete the picture. The covered veranda 
        overlooks the tropical rainforest mountains and the river. Weekends are 
        free for exploration, sightseeing or just relaxing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The Clinic is new and spacious. A 
        large pharmacy stocked with donated and bought drugs serves the 
        community as in most third world clinics there is a vast amount of 
        donated supplies. You have to wade through it to find what is useful for 
        you. Ideally you would organize and bring with you donations of meds and 
        supplies for your own use. That way you reduce your chance&nbsp;of 
        being&nbsp;caught short. The OR has a good Storz&nbsp;operating microscope. There 
        is a rather ancient Bowie cautery, office suction, an OR table, 
        OR&nbsp;surgical stretcher, and multiple sterilizers. There are sufficient 
        instruments to see patients all day without resterilizing. There are 
        some old instruments for septoplasties and tonsillectomies, but no 
        mouthgag. </font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Any potentially interested ENT 
        person should plan to bring all special instruments for surgical 
        procedures. That includes prostheses, gelfoam, eardrops, steroid nasal 
        sprays, PE tubes, etc. There were several ossicular reconstructions I 
        could not do because of lack of equipment. I used up the entire pharmacy 
        supply of cortisone nasal sprays. Also the chromic catgut sutures 
        started to run low. I brought a portable audiometer that turned out to 
        be extremely useful.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">There is a broad range of ENT 
        problems here, similar to those found in the U.S. This includes a large 
        backlog of needed tonsillectomies, traumatic nasal deformities, 
        tympanoplasties and ossicular reconstructions. I generated the surgeries 
        as I saw the patients and could fill one to two surgery days per week. I 
        often did tympanoplasties on the spot as the patients&nbsp;walked in. Even 
        though there are many children with chronic MOE,&nbsp;the adults seem to hide 
        out and only trickle in.&nbsp;I had some surgery patients appear on my last 
        day here.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">There is presently no 
        anesthesiologist or OR nurse in Guadalupe. Amanda, the clinic nurse, 
        helps with setting things up and sterilization. Fortunately most ENT 
        procedures are one-person operations. I did tympanoplasties under local. 
        Initially I did some tonsils and noses with Ketamine and Versed, which I 
        bought in Quito on my way here. High-dose Ketamine brought of course all 
        the known emergence problems with that drug. I switched to Propofol as 
        long as Lori was there to help me.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Later Padre Jorge and I went to 
        the hospital in Zamora and arranged for surgeries under general 
        anesthesia there. The hospital is rather antiquated and has extremely 
        limited supplies. We brought everything with us, from needles to meds to 
        sutures to instruments. Amanda was tireless in helping to translate, 
        organize, carry supplies and keep the financial tap running, as well as 
        keeping the good spirit going. We got up at 5 am to catch the bus to 
        Zamora.&nbsp; On the way to the hospital we scoured the large indoor market 
        for rye flour, veggies and meat for our weekend feasts.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The anesthesia personnel at the 
        hospital are a mixed bag. The first anesthesiologist&nbsp;we had was slick 
        and experienced, even with conscious sedation. On other occasions it was 
        rather slow and rough going. In order to keep the cost down Amanda 
        organized our own meds and bought what each anesthesiologist requested. 
        We even supplied the gloves.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">If an ENT person were able to 
        bring along an OR nurse for help, like some of the ophthalmologists 
        do,&nbsp;it would simplify things greatly.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">It is difficult to line up 
        surgeries in sufficient quantities to keep an anesthesiologist you bring 
        with you busy all the time. The patients don't show up on time or are 
        difficult to reach. In the long run I feel it would be much easier to 
        arrange for an anesthesiologist from Zamora to come to Guadalupe as 
        needed, and activate the donated anesthesia machine that the Clinic has.</font></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Bring pounds of flexibility to 
        adjust to third world medicine. I had a very rewarding experience, and 
        hope to return again next year.</font></p>

        <font size="2">It was very nice to return to the Guadalupe Clinic and 
        see progress being made. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">My hope was to avoid bringing all our equipment to the 
        hospital in Zamora and instead bringing the anesthesiologist to 
        Guadalupe. Despite political turmoil in Ecuador and a nationwide doctor 
        strike, we were able to hire <span lang="es"><a href="CedeñoRori.htm">
        Dra. Rori Cedeño</a></span>, the anesthesiologist<span lang="es">,</span> 
        with whom I worked together with very well last year.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">The <b>anesthesia machine</b> was up and running but had not 
        been used before with gases. The machine has an Enflurane and an 
        Isoflurane evaporator. I learned from <span lang="es">Dra. Rori</span> 
        that Halothane can easily be used in these evaporators.&nbsp; The latter one 
        would actually be better for Halothane since both gases have the same 
        vapor pressure.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <span lang="es"><font size="2">Rori</font></span><font size="2"> came on 
        three days and we did tonsil and rhinoplastic surgeries. On the last 
        visit we did seven rhinoplasties in one day. We used general anesthesia 
        with Halothane in the Enflurane evaporator without any problems. The 
        turnover time between cases was amazingly short.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">Because of the inevitable snafus, we weren’t able to 
        schedule enough general anesthesia days, so I started doing 
        septoplasties under local anesthesia. The lack of cocaine is a real 
        drawback. I had to use Afrin and 5% Lidocaine ointment, which has 
        problems. Upon Ro<span lang="es">ri</span>’s advice I also started using 
        Fentanyl 2mcg/ kg as sedation which worked out quite well in conjunction 
        with Versed.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">It became obvious that once you start doing surgeries in 
        earnest (we did 75 cases in the 5 weeks I was there) you run out of 
        supplies fast. The #15 blades ran out and sedation meds got used up; 
        also the fiberglass casting material. The Gelfoam I brought ran out on 
        the last day.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">In response to the need for more complex tympanoplasties 
        and ossicular implants, I extended my ear instruments for post-auricular 
        approaches and brought a <b>mini-drill</b> to shape ossicular implants. </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">I did all the tympanoplasties and three stapesplasties

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">If we had a <b>mastoid drill</b> we could also operate the 
        cholesteatoma patients under general anesthesia as outpatient. I have 
        been doing cholesteatoma surgery in an outpatient setting in the United 
        States for decades. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
        <font size="2">I ran out of TORP and stapes prostheses in the end. It 
        would be nice if some TORP, PORP and Stapes prostheses were donated. 
        Since I myself am presently not in a clinical setting, I have a hard 
        time getting my hands on prostheses.</font></p>

        Retired Annapolis doctor helps the poor in Ecuador</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
        </span>
        <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Helvetica">By 
        THERESA WINSLOW, Staff Writer</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
        Like many physicians, Dr. Burger Zapf got into medicine because he 
        wanted to help people. So, in retirement, the Annapolis ear, nose and 
        throat specialist saw no reason to stop. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB">The 58-year-old has already made two trips to a 
        clinic in the Amazon region of Ecuador to help the region's poor, and 
        will depart for another stint there next month. This is in addition to 
        work he's already done in Mexico and other volunteering he did in 
        Jamaica and St. Lucia when he still had his practice. The volunteering 
        is interwoven with his other passion, sailing. Dr. Zapf and his wife, 
        Nancy, will continue a protracted sail around the world after he 
        completes his latest stay at the South American mission clinic.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;If you can help someone, it doesn't matter 
        where you are,&quot; Dr. Zapf said, flashing a smile. &quot;It fits my 
        personality. ... There's clearly a need.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Zapf's previous stints at Clinica Misonal 
        &quot;Nuestra Senora De Guadalupe&quot; have lasted four to five weeks, and during 
        that time he saw a variety of patients, usually from the indigenous 
        population of Saraguro and Shuar Indians. They are examined on a 
        first-come, first-served basis and pay $1 per visit, Dr. Zapf said.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">The vast majority of the work involves nasal 
        and ear problems, although he's also done other kinds of treatment 
        there. A nurse translates Spanish for him, so language barriers aren't a 
        problem.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Many of the medical issues he encounters with 
        patients aren't that different from those in America, though there are 
        exceptions. He spoke of one patient who made a return visit to him after 
        surgery and had 13 full-grown maggots living in his ear.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Aside from those kinds of cases, one of the 
        major differences in medicine is the lack of red tape that exists at the 
        clinic. When he still practiced here, he said, dealing with insurance 
        companies took up lots of time.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;There, it all falls away,&quot; he said. &quot;People 
        need you.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">They also admire his dedication.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;We really appreciate him a lot,&quot; the Rev. 
        Jorge Nigsch, the director of the clinic, wrote in an e-mail. &quot;He is 
        very generous, a hard worker, with good humor and an excellent doctor. 
        He is a problem-solver, he knows how to adapt to new situations and make 
        the best out if it. He is fun to be with.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Zapf said he gets along with the Rev. 
        Nigsch especially well because of their heritage. Dr. Zapf was born in 
        Germany and the Rev. Nigsch is from Austria.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">The Rev. Nigsch said the staff is looking 
        forward to the physician's return next month. So is Dr. Zapf, who 
        relishes the problem-solving aspect of the clinic work, since there 
        isn't always the same kind of equipment he had at his disposal when he 
        practiced here. He retired about four years ago, wanting to devote more 
        time to volunteering and sailing.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">The problem-solving can involve everything 
        from improvising his own medical instruments, like a specialized suction 
        machine, to making a homemade prosthesis for the inner ear when one 
        wasn't available.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;I like it,&quot; he said, sitting in his home and 
        showing pictures of the clinic on his computer. &quot;I like to solve 
        problems. Things like this are never easy, and we just solve problems as 
        they arise.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Creature comforts</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">While the clinic is the jungle, staying there 
        isn't exactly roughing it, Dr. Zapf said. He said the accommodations are 
        fine with him and shrugged off any suggestion that his time there 
        represented any kind of hardship.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Still, there's no air conditioning, and he has 
        a picture of a tarantula he found one day in his bedroom. A nurse told 
        him she found a pair of the spiders in another room. Rubber skirts under 
        the front door keep out snakes.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Zapf first found out about the clinic 
        after searching the Internet for volunteer opportunities. Mrs. Zapf, who 
        serves on the board of the Seven Seas Cruising Association, said she 
        recognizes his need to help people and doesn't worry about his trips to 
        remote regions to do the work.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;He's very self-reliant,&quot; she said.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">His past trips to Ecuador have worked out 
        great, because she said she got to spend time at home working on taxes 
        while he was at the clinic. This time, he'll fly to Ecuador first and 
        she'll join him in December. They then plan to travel the country and 
        nearby Peru before setting sail for the South Pacific.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">Their 50-foot sloop, <i>Halekai, </i>is 
        already in Ecuador. The name is Polynesian and roughly translates to 
        &quot;home on the ocean,&quot; or &quot;houseboat.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">He finds his time at sea just as rewarding as 
        his time at the clinic.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span lang="EN-GB">&quot;I like ... adventures,&quot; Dr. Zapf said.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 7.5pt"><br>

      Third ENT visit-&nbsp;fall 2006</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">To 
      prepare for this visit I approached several companies for help. Gyrus ENT 
      was extremely helpful in providing scores of middle ear prostheses,&nbsp; PE 
      tubes and a new sinus Gel. They were also willing to give us a mastoid 
      drill but I ended up on the number 2 spot on the waiting list. My 
      approaches to the Catholic Mission Board turned out to be frustrating, 
      fruitless and a total waste of time. I updated my middle ear instrument 
      with great discounts from Gyrus ENT and arrived in Guadalupe ready to go.
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">The 
      clinic-office set-up was now done in a flash and almost routine.The 
      existing full complement of office examination instruments was put aside 
      by Amanda and we just had to open the box to get going.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">The 
      patient mix was again similar to previous visits: Lot of stress related 
      throat pain, TMJ, Hyoid syndrome, traumatic and cosmetic nasal and 
      septal&nbsp;problems, chronic tonsillitis and&nbsp;chronic middle ear disease, some 
      pretty bad (one very large cholesteatoma, which I was able to operate in 
      the clinic OR) and some otosclerosis. Scores of sensory neural hearing 
      losses in need&nbsp;of hearing aids, which we presently don´t have. A fair 
      amount of patients came from afar (4 bus changes) for a second opinion. 
      Often for clearly unnecessary surgery. </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">
      Again a dizzying amount of high school teenage boys who wanted cosmetic 
      nasal surgery and required serious talking to.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">The 
      concept of doing some cosmetic surgery to finance the indigent patient 
      procedures under general anesthesia seems to work out and we came out 
      financially clean at the end.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dra. Rori 
      Cedeñ</font><font size="2">o <span lang="EN-GB">was again hired for 
      procedures under general anesthesia in the clinic OR. She is a 
      very&nbsp;experienced and amazingly slick anesthesiologist who can do Halothane 
      cases with instant wake up!</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Due 
      to scheduling problems we did one surgery day at the hospital in Zamora. 
      With the new Peruvian president a new hospital administrator came in and 
      is very interested in a cooperation with the Guadalupe clinic. They also 
      donated the drugs and materials for the surgeries that allowed </span>the 
      nurse <span lang="EN-GB">Amanda </span>Anderson <span lang="EN-GB">to give 
      refunds to the patients. The hospital OR has now a new anesthesia machine, 
      nice cautery and suction. Sterilization is done with dry heat process! 
      &nbsp;Watch the wraps! The nurses seemed very competent and cooperative. The 
      anesthesia (Fredy) is more geared to long cases and not so much for fast 
      outpatient turn over. </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">On 
      the social side we again had lots of fun, great hiking &nbsp;and great cooking. 
      I showed padres niece how to bake German rye bread hoping this will 
      finally sink into the cooking operation at the mission.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">I 
      was lucky to witness the festival for the Madonna de Guadalupe.</font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">A 
      large crowd of pilgrims</span> <span lang="EN-GB">(including the 
      volunteers)&nbsp; wandering&nbsp; 23 km through neighboring towns carrying the 
      Madonna in front.&nbsp;This also included, early in the morning, the marching 
      into town&nbsp;of a steer&nbsp;behind a&nbsp;brass band, slaughter and butchering in the 
      town square of the poor animal and finally beef soup cookout for the whole 
      town. During the marching the first question of every passer by &nbsp;was: how 
      much did the steer cost( $250, payed for by the large organizing 
      committee). The festival included car racing, motorcross racing, 
      fireworks, public dancing and at the end Las Chicas del Fuego- a group of 
      scantily G-string clad girls singing and dancing shaking their behinds at 
      the cheering crowd. </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">My 
      contribution to the festival was selecting a big piece of beef on site and 
      cooking a <strong>real </strong>gourmet goulash soup for the organizing 
      committee.(Not sure of their tastes I cooked a trial version first). All 
      of this served for lunch with crusty rye bread and beer. </font></span>
