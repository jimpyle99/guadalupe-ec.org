        <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US">Having seen 
        Guadalupe Clinic’s website, I was not surprised at the bridge we crossed 
        to get there, or at the clean, inviting surroundings.&nbsp; What did catch me 
        off guard was the hospitality of the sisters and Padre Jorge</span> 
        Nigsch<span lang="EN-US">.&nbsp; It was as if we were all that was important 
        in their day.&nbsp; We arrived just in time for lunch, and were to leave in a 
        few hours for the first destination of our Jornada:&nbsp; Chicana.&nbsp; We had 
        warm welcomes and good turnouts at most of our destinations.&nbsp; What is 
        surprising is how healthy the people are.&nbsp; In our 6 locations and 
        roughly 600 patient visits, there was only a handful who really needed 
        help.&nbsp; Many of them had, in fact, already seen a doctor.&nbsp; The most 
        common complaints were headaches, heartburn, low back pain, and body 
        pain (dolor del cuerpo).&nbsp; We gave out very few antibiotics.&nbsp; I felt much 
        better about the emotional connections we made than about the actual 
        medicine we did.&nbsp; The people were so friendly and for the most part 
        appreciative.&nbsp; One of the most connective times was our home stay with a 
        family of 5 in Chicana who all piled into one room with twin beds while 
        each of 2 American couples got their own room.&nbsp; Despite language and 
        cultural barriers, these people were welcoming, trusting, and so very 
        kind.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing how they received our medical advice or 
        whether they took the meds we gave them.&nbsp; But I do know that they had 
        the undivided attention of an American doc, and a fairly complete exam, 
        all for $1 and I feel good about that.&nbsp; If I were to return, I would 
        make more of an effort to support the existing medical system:&nbsp; the 
        government clinics and the medicos who run them.&nbsp; We could learn from 
        them about the indigenous diseases and herbal remedies, and they could 
        learn some of our western knowledge and approach. </span></font></p>
