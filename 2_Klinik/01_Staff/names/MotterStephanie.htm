        Upon arrival, we were greeted at the
        Mission by the Padre, four Sisters, an American nurse and another 
        volunteer.&nbsp;
        Padre Jorge Nigsch and the Sisters 
        are welcoming, warm and fun.&nbsp; I enjoyed spending time with them during 
        my week stay in Guadalupe.&nbsp; After getting settled in the volunteers’ 
        residence, we checked out the clinic.&nbsp; My preceptor, Dr. 
        Serle Epstein, was encouraging when I expressed my uncertainty with 
        tropical medicine and the way medicine is practiced in a developing 
        country.&nbsp; He insisted that “common things are common” no matter where 
        one practices, and indeed he was correct.&nbsp; Throughout the week I managed 
        patients with common health problems:&nbsp; hypertension, diabetes, 
        muscular-skeletal problems and a variety of women’s health issues.&nbsp; I 
        performed ear lavages on patients whose ear canals were impacted with 
        cerumen.&nbsp; I used the nebulizer to deliver treatments to asthmatics.&nbsp; And 
        I provided lots of patient education regarding gastritis/reflux disease, 
        urinary tract infections and depression.&nbsp; I was really impressed with 
        the capabilities of our simple laboratory and with the wide variety of 
        medications that were available from our on-site pharmacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also 
        amazed by the knowledge and patience of
        Amanda Anderson, the full time nurse who essentially runs the 
        clinic, and by Rita, 
        a local woman who is responsible for all the daily goings-on in the 
        front office.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        One particular afternoon I had the wonderful experience of accompanying 
        Sister Andrea and another American volunteer to a nearby village.&nbsp; We 
        took a bus from Guadalupe and hopped off when we got to our stop which 
        was a half-mile trail studded with grazing cows.&nbsp; We followed the trail 
        to a suspended foot bridge that crossed the river.&nbsp; Once across, we 
        followed a frontage road for over a mile into the village.&nbsp; Sister 
        Andrea gathered all the kids and commenced a youth group where- in what 
        seemed like a world away from Connecticut- I played a version of the 
        same games and sang a version of the same songs from my own childhood 
        over 20 years ago.&nbsp; The day ended with a game of soccer where we played 
        girls against boys, and the girls won!<br>
        <br>
        I arrived at the mission clinic as a nurse practitioner student in my 
        final year of training.&nbsp; I left the mission clinic having had the time 
        of my life.&nbsp; I made several new friendships with both the more permanent 
        folks at the mission as well as with other volunteers who each had a 
        unique story and reason for being there.&nbsp; Likewise, I developed a 
        greater sense of self-confidence regarding my clinical skills, and I 
        learned to trust my judgment related to patient care…<br>
        <br>
        I absolutely hope to return to Guadalupe again.&nbsp; If you are considering 
        a trip there to volunteer your time and skills, please seriously 
        consider three things:&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        1.&nbsp; Learn as much Spanish as you can.&nbsp; Even if you are not fluent or 
        even proficient, any little bit helps.&nbsp; <br>
        2.&nbsp; Work closely with Amanda for at least one day while you are in the 
        clinic.&nbsp; Her awareness of the local resources and culture is truly 
        amazing, and working with her added to my experience.&nbsp; <br>
        3.&nbsp; Attend mass or accompany the Sisters to the villages (no matter what 
        your own religious faith) because it is a good way to get better 
        acquainted with the local people, their traditions and their way of 
        life.&nbsp; Likewise, it allows the chance to take in the incredible views 
        and sights that seemed to be worthy of photographing at every turn.</font><p align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
