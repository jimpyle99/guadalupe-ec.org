<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I spent a 
terrific and unforgettable week and a half at the Mission <br>
Clinic in November 2005. This was my first overseas work experience, an <br>
endeavor I strongly feel I was led to undertake. In making the decision <br>
to do so, the information on the excellent web site along with many <br>
e-mail and personal contacts with Dr. Serle Epstein were extremely <br>
helpful. I was attracted to this location as a place for a short term <br>
assignment for a few reasons. I liked the fact it was on a Catholic <br>
mission. [Although this was important to me, it was less so or <br>
completely unimportant to most of the other volunteers who were there <br>
during my stay. The atmosphere is extremely ecumenical. Participating <br>
in some of the religious aspects of the experience such as mealtime <br>
prayers, mass, etc. seemed interesting and meaningful even to those who <br>
were not Catholic.] I also liked the fact that an established clinic <br>
was up and running on a continuous basis.&nbsp; I chose the weeks I did <br>
since I felt it would help my adjustment on a short stint to have <br>
another physician already experienced in Guadalupe during my stay. As <br>
it turned out, I had two other physicians during my two weeks. On one <br>
hand, this kept the volume quite low for any one of us on any <br>
particular day (about 10/day/physician). On the other hand, the <br>
camaraderie and opportunity to discuss cases was extremely stimulating <br>
and enjoyable. Working with and getting to know the other two docs, <br>
<a href="JonesKerry.htm">Kerry Jones</a> and <a href="AlberMichael.htm">Michael 
Alber</a>, definitely provided some of the high <br>
points of the experience for me. <a href="AndersonAmy.htm">Amanda Anderson</a> 
is absolutely <br>
invaluable in the clinic and, in retrospect, I believe that even a <br>
short term stint would be quite manageable by oneself if Amanda is <br>
available. Especially, if one has a good working knowledge of Spanish. <br>
I would emphasize what is stated on the web site, which is that <br>
knowledge of Spanish is very important.<br>
<br>
As a family physician, I found the patients were not dissimilar to <br>
those I see in the states. Before going, I re-acquainted myself with <br>
some of the tropical diseases I hadn't read about since med school - <br>
leishmaniasis, bartonellosis, dengue, etc. As it turned out, I didn't <br>
see any of those but lots of typical primary care problems - headaches, <br>
depression, menstrual and gyn problems, musculoskeletal complaints, <br>
etc. I saw some things very commonly here that are seen, but are less <br>
common in the states (USA) such as pterygia and parasitosis. There were <br>
also fair numbers of unusual and interesting problems. In the week and <br>
a half I was there I saw (among my patients and the other docs) a large <br>
thyroid mass, a patient with probable Sheehan's syndrome, a large <br>
baker's cyst, a third degree AC sprain (one year old but never treated) <br>
in a 46 year old woman who was G18P16, probable reoccurrence of TB,&nbsp; <br>
and a partial rupture of the pectoralis muscle presenting as a chest <br>
wall mass.<br>
<br>
Although this was technically a &quot;working vacation&quot; it was as much or <br>
more recharging than a purely recreational vacation. The pace is <br>
relaxed, the people (Padre Jorge, the hermanas, Amanda and the clinic <br>
staff, and the other volunteers) are extraordinary, the work is <br>
stimulating and interesting, and the setting is absolutely magnificent. <br>
The facilities are outstanding for those of a developing country. The <br>
clinic is well stocked and set up and the volunteers' residence is <br>
wonderful. The photos taken from the residence do not do complete <br>
justice to the extraordinary setting. One of my favorite impressions <br>
from the trip is sitting on the terrace looking down a stunning emerald <br>
green valley between mountain ranges with myriads of brightly colored <br>
birds singing and flitting about. Remarkably peaceful!<br>
<br>
I would be happy to speak or e-mail with anyone considering spending <br>
some time at the clinic.<br>
