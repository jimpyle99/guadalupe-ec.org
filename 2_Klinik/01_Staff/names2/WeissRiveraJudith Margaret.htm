My excuse, or Tutupalli</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason that I could not attend the last meeting is 
that I fell off a mule.&nbsp; I had just returned from Ecuador the night before the 
meeting. Four days earlier, on a steep, muddy trail, I fell over the front of a 
mule onto my head.&nbsp; I sustained a seven inch scalp laceration and a large 
hematoma.&nbsp; Fortunately, the hematoma was outside my skull and my neck, though 
still too stiff to allow me to sleep on my stomach without suffocating, did not 
break.&nbsp; I am doing much better, and I hope to make it to the next meeting.&nbsp;
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was I perched on the back of a mule on a wooden 
rack covered with a folded blanket as I descended a muddy, boulder strewn path 
just 40 degrees from perpendicular?&nbsp; I was leaving Tutupalli the sixth day of a 
medical jornada.&nbsp; We, that is three doctors, a dentist, a nurse, and various 
helpers, were traveling to see patients in various remote communities on the 
eastern slope of the Andes, dragging our equipment and pharmacy with us.&nbsp; Lucky 
for me, the dentist had two leftover vials of lidocaine and 3 sutures, and one 
of my colleagues had done extensive moonlighting in an ER.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutupalli was lovely. It lies in a beautiful valley at 
7500 feet.&nbsp; Most of the inhabitants are Saraguri, an Andean indigenous group.&nbsp; 
It is semi tropical; they grow bananas and yucca for personal use, and some 
coffee, but it is too high for mango, avocado, tamarindo.&nbsp; Tutupalli is built on 
a small point above the convergence of two rushing mountain rivers.&nbsp; Due to the 
lack of either road or navigable river, the surrounding hills have not been 
subjected to the widespread deforestation of the Andes.&nbsp; There is no way to get 
the wood to market.&nbsp; Small sections of mountain sides have been cleared to graze 
cows, but there are no large herds.&nbsp; Looking up one would often see the strange 
sight of a Holstein tethered precariously at the top of a steep green mountain 
top.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless there are heavy rains with their ensuing 
landslides, it no longer takes a four hour hike or mule ride to reach Tutupalli. 
The new road has shortened the trip to one and a half hours.&nbsp; Once we arrived at 
the end of the road, I cleverly volunteered to walk down the steep trail to 
Tutupalli, as there were not enough mules to carry all of us and our equipment.&nbsp; 
Though it took me longer to walk down than it took the men from town to carry me 
up two days later, it was a pleasant walk.&nbsp; Steep, muddy, hard on the knees, 
with abundant evidence of mule traffic: still lovely.&nbsp; Entering the valley was 
like entering Shangri La.&nbsp; To the west a huge double waterfall poured down the 
green mountainside from a height of 10,000 feet.&nbsp; Though too distant for us to 
hear it’s roar, the view was our constant companion on the way down.&nbsp; The 
intense green of the valley was crowded with brilliant purple trees.&nbsp; Swarms of 
iridescent blue and black and orange and black butterflies decorated the path; 
they flowed ahead of me in a knee high cloud when my rubber boots disturbed 
them.&nbsp; I now understand how Gabriel Garcia Marquez imagined his plague of 
butterflies.&nbsp; He merely embroidered a bit on reality.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly my face was red when I reached the town, 
after climbing &nbsp;the brief uphill stretch from the bridge.&nbsp; Some one generously 
handed me one of the last bottles of water in town. We briefly examined the 
clinic before going to eat the lunch that had been prepared for us.&nbsp; 
Fortunately, I had dirtied my scrubs when I slid on the trail on the way into 
town, so there was no choice but to bathe in the river before beginning work.&nbsp; 
The second river was a rushing torrent edged with Volkswagen sized boulders.&nbsp; 
Several huge boulders were conveniently grouped to form a protected sandy beach. 
We arrived just as a group of smiling boys were leaving, lugging plastic baskets 
of clothes they had washed.&nbsp; School was out so that the teachers could go home 
to vote in the upcoming election. The boys decided we were the best show in 
town–they had not yet seen our young German dentist in her bikini– and retraced 
their steps to watch us swim. From the water I watched families walking on the 
path above the other side of river, trailing mules and children, then crossing 
the suspension bridge down river into town to consult us.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutupalli was a town of 78 people, with many more 
living in the surrounding countryside.&nbsp; Most were subsistence farmers. &nbsp;The town 
has a center square, a few muddy streets, a school, a locked church, and a 
government clinic.&nbsp; A paved basketball/volleyball court occupied the main 
square, the only pavement in twenty-five miles.&nbsp; The nearest pavement was 
another basketball court in the town down the road.&nbsp; The closest paved road was 
at least 50 miles. The street surrounding the main square was that in name 
only.&nbsp; Impassable for any wheeled vehicle, it had a steep ten foot drop off 
between the clinic side and the guest house side, and contained many hassock 
sized boulders.&nbsp; Clearly it was designed with foot or mule traffic in mind.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the people were Saraguris, with a few 
mestizo families who had founded the town several generations before. Many of 
the older people did not speak Spanish, while most of my contemporaries spoke it 
as a second language. &nbsp;The Saraguri men were attractive: fit, self confident, 
polite.&nbsp; They wore their hair in a long braid hanging between their shoulder 
blades.&nbsp; They wore black trousers cut off just below the knee to accommodate the 
ubiquitous rubber boots.&nbsp; The women wore several layers of full black skirts, no 
longer hand woven but machine embroidered; white blouse, two braids, and a small 
black bowler hat. Surprisingly, this lush green valley was less fertile than the 
more barren appearing highlands.&nbsp; Much of the population migrated up to the 
higher altitudes for four months a year to grow a crop of mote (Andean corn) or 
beans, or a cash crop of tree tomatoes.&nbsp; Rather than taking the three-bus, 
twelve hour trip by road, most walked with their families over the Cordillera, 
carrying what they needed on mules.&nbsp; The priest told me they loaded the mules 
high with feed sacks containing their worldly goods, tied a crate of chickens on 
one side, a crate of cuyes-guinea pigs-on the other, and topped it off with the 
guaguioto, or baby.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tutupalli, the diet was high in starch, low in 
protein.&nbsp; No one was fat,&nbsp; We ate mote, the large white Andean corn, and yucca 
fried with onions and eggs.&nbsp; Most local people got their protein from homemade 
cheese, and occasional eggs and beans.&nbsp; Cheese was a practical way to preserve 
milk without refrigeration, and to make it digestible for those without 
lactase.&nbsp; No one would butcher a cow to eat, though if necessary they would sell 
it to get cash.&nbsp; We did eat one chicken, I don’t know which one.&nbsp; Our hostess 
did not charge us for it, though it was not included in the price of the meal.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;In Tutupalli, as 
everywhere else in Ecuador, we drank highly sweetened herb tea, cold or hot. In 
Tutupalli it was special.&nbsp; Mostly we had Agua de la Reina Sofia, pure lemon 
grass and delicious.&nbsp; After we admired the archeological site-a carved rock—in 
someone’s back yard—we were shown a begonia bush as big as a sofa, and later 
drank intense red tea made from the flowers.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stayed 
in an adobe house, quite warm; the bathroom (Running water! Toilet paper!) was 
reached by walking the length of the covered wooden veranda, then crossing the 
muddy yard on a twelve foot log plank and stepping stones.&nbsp; There were electric 
lights on the square and in our building, as well as a jury rigged system in the 
clinic that could be turned on and off by pushing the plunger of a syringe in 
and out.&nbsp; There was no TV, no radio, though the boy upstairs had at least one CD 
he liked a lot. At night we sat in the veranda and watched a group of six 
adolescents play volley ball for hours, no stopping for the rain. Like in 
Camelot, it apparently rained mostly at night there.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
clinic was staffed by a health worker with limited training.&nbsp; She offered 
condoms and a few medicines.&nbsp; She was the only overweight person we saw in 
Tutupalli, as she spent most days indoors.&nbsp; Working in the clinic tarnished the 
luster of Tutupalli a bit. The reality of subsistence farming was a harsh.&nbsp; Kids 
were short.&nbsp; They looked great while they were breast-fed; once weaned, it was 
clear that there had been a shortage of food when they were toddlers.&nbsp; The 
smiley six year old at the river was a the size of a western 4 year old, 40 
inches, 40 pounds.&nbsp; The ten year old looked like a precocious American six year 
old. Most of my contemporaries were illiterate.&nbsp; No one of any age wore glasses, 
whether they could see or not.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In two 
days we collectively saw three women over forty who might be pregnant.&nbsp; Two 
were, and not happy about it.&nbsp; One complained bitterly of the nine children she 
already had and could not feed.&nbsp; To obtain birth control other than condoms 
required a minimum monthly eight hour trip.&nbsp; One had to take a one and a half 
hour hike and two hour bus ride to the closest government health center where 
one could get a monthly injection or package of pills.&nbsp; (That is, if the 
soon-to-graduate medical student doing his or her rural practice was there, 
which was unreliably infrequent.) &nbsp;That would be a monthly eight hour trip.&nbsp; 
Alternatively, the two day round trip to Loja for a fifty dollar government 
subsidized IUD was a better deal, but fifty dollars was a months’ income for a 
family. In Ecuador, there are many IUFD's; (Intra-Uterine Fetal Demise); a 
dangerous alternative.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite 
these limitations, Tutupalli was a wonderful place. Tranquil. Pleasant.&nbsp; An 
organized community.&nbsp; The people carried themselves with quiet self respect.&nbsp; I 
was sad to leave.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day 
we left, we planned to ride mules up the hill so as not to waste time on our way 
to the next clinic.&nbsp; I had forgotten that the first section of the path was a 
slick steep downhill stretch no more than forty degrees from perpendicular.&nbsp; My 
mule had a wooden rack on its back that was normally used for tying on cargo, 
covered with a folded blanket. It had a two inch rim front and back and two 
shallow stirrups dangling from the rack by rope. My mule was led by an eleven 
year old girl I had treated the day before.&nbsp; As she pulled its reins, the mule 
descended sharply.&nbsp; I was trying to get my foot back in the stirrup, and the 
next thing I knew I fell over the top of the mule down the hill onto my head.&nbsp; I 
must have missed the basketball sized rocks that studded the path, for I was not 
knocked out. After sitting and cursing in disbelief—luckily no one spoke 
English, so they could not understand the words at least of the doctor from the 
day before—I was able to walk up the hill to the clinic holding my scalp 
together.&nbsp; I lost my really great hat.&nbsp; I understand protected my scalp from the 
mud and mule droppings, but between the blood and the mud was deemed 
unsalvageable.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As I mentioned 
previously, the dentist had a two small leftover vials of lidocaine and three 
sutures, so it was my lucky day.&nbsp; I had a beautiful seven inch laceration down 
to the skull, which started in the middle of my forehead, turned&nbsp; sharply two 
inches into the scalp to end about an inch above my right ear.&nbsp; Sadly, there was 
no razor, so my scalp could not be shaved. (What a pity.)&nbsp; While one of my 
colleagues sewed me up, the men from town got busy constructing a stretcher from 
four handhewn hardwood boards fastened together with nylon rope.&nbsp; In the mean 
time, the clinic was called and an ambulance was dispatched to the end of the 
road.&nbsp; (Had I mentioned that there was a telephone in Tutupalli?&nbsp; One could even 
call the US from there.&nbsp; There was not much privacy though; one sat at a desk 
yelling into the staticky phone while anyone who was interested—and many 
were—crowded around the large open window to listen in.)</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 
suturing and stretcher were finished, I was carried up the hill by eight local 
men, trading off, four at a time.&nbsp; They made it in an hour, the same path it had 
taken me almost two hours to descend. They took off my rubber boots too lighten 
the load, but I doubt it helped much.&nbsp; They made jokes as they jogged down the 
first steep slope and across the river, but on the way up had to save their 
breath.&nbsp; I had two sand bags: literally, two garbage bags full of sand from the 
beach- the beautiful beach we swam at the day before.&nbsp; At the top of the trail, 
I was transferred to a rudimentary ambulance. I kept my two sand bags, as they 
were the only ones available.&nbsp; They leaked a little. The townspeople felt sorry 
for me when the sand got in my face.&nbsp; But by that time, I was worried that might 
be the least of my problems.&nbsp; I had a huge hematoma on the side of my head and a 
very sore neck.&nbsp; Who knows what that meant.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus 
began the six hour ambulance trip: lying on my back clutching two leaking 
sandbags as we jolted over pot holed, unpaved roads, blood stiffening my hair 
and soaking my back, to Loja, sight of the nearest CT scanner.&nbsp; Do I sound like 
I was feeling a bit sorry for myself?&nbsp; I was worried.&nbsp; Though I had walked, I 
was worried I had broken my neck.&nbsp; My neck hurt more than my head the entire 
time. It still does.&nbsp; From eight in the morning to 5:30 was a fairly long time 
to contemplate a possibly broken neck.&nbsp; The funny part was, as the road 
gradually improved, becoming banked and graveled and ultimately paved, I heard 
my fall and injury being announced on the local news. I was famous. As they say, 
no good deed goes unpunished.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 36.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not 
punished too harshly, though.&nbsp; No broken neck, no subdural hematoma.&nbsp; The CT 
Scans were cheap: only sixty dollars each, though my local radiologist made fun 
of the thickness of the slices.&nbsp; I spent a few days in Loja, as my bus seatmate 
had suggested on the way down.&nbsp; Actually, I spent most of the time in a small 
convent being cared for by a wonderful and very competent nun who was about to 
finish her nursing training.&nbsp; I did get to see a bit of that pleasant city.&nbsp; I 
was the subject of a sermon on sacrifice and suffering as a prerequisite for 
salvation.&nbsp; I made it home in one piece, and recuperated. I now have only a 
large numb patch on my scalp, a red scar, and a stiff neck.&nbsp; And a memory of 
beautiful Tutupalli.&nbsp; I would like to return one day, before the road is 
finished and the trees are cut down and they yank the boulders out of the 
streets around the square.&nbsp; Before it loses its sweetness.</font></span></p>
