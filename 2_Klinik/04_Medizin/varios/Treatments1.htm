        Depression is always in the background whenever someone visits with 
        chronic and recurrent difficulties. Also musculoskeletal problems are 
        rampant in this setting. &nbsp;</span></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eczema may play a role. This and fungal infections are 
        predisposed to by the damp environment and wearing rubber boots. Other 
        possibilities may include iron and other vitamin deficiency&nbsp;or anemia 
        from whatever cause. The diet is not very balanced and green vegetables 
        and red meat are in short supply. Diabetes, mainly non insulin 
        dependent, is also more common than I might have thought prior to my 
        visits and certainly can contribute to neuropathy. Although you may 
        treat empirically, a glucose and spun hematocrit on select patients 
        might be useful. Lumbar or cervical radiculopathy may also be present, 
        as back problems are a common complaint. They often use the term kidney 
        problem to mean that the back hurts. When I cou</span><span lang="es" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">l</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">d 
        not tease out the problem I sometimes used the local menthol cream or

        <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dysuria in women seemed to go hand in hand with chronic 
        vaginitis and sometimes pelvic prolapse and atrophic vaginitis. Many men 
        seemed to have chronic prostatitis. Only sporadically did I see 
        urethritis. Although people seemed to think that they had kidney stones 
        only a few did, and their urine sediment was usually active. I did see 
        some urinary tract infections. The clinical examination was often the 
        best way to sort this out. Urinalysis and vaginal smears could be 
        helpful in select cases. If I saw a heavy purulent discharge I might 
        treat for gonorrhea with perhaps a quinolone, and also cover with a 
        macrolide for chlamydia, but we are not able to culture, and gram 
        staining is cumbersome if no one in the laboratory will ! do it for you 
        and patients are waiting. Prostatitis I treated with 10 days of a 
        quinolone or macrolide. Vaginitis I tried to treat a bit more 
        specifically by its’ apparent etiology.</span></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is problematic. There may be a psychological overlay to 
        this complaint. At times this may reflect marital discord or other 
        sexual issues. That being said, I did a number of vaginal smears. I have 
        yet to see trichomonas. Surprisingly frequently I came across clue 
        cells. Much less common than I expected was monilia. I think that 
        treating for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin or 
        perhaps amoxicillin may be reasonable if you do not see finding of 
        yeast. If suspecting chlamydia or gonorrhea&nbsp;you&nbsp;should&nbsp;individualize the 
        medication. I do think that man! y women are actually re-infected by 
        their husbands after initial successful therapy. Extra marital sex and 
        using prostitutes in not unusual. </span></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflux is not uncommon. I think this is more common than true 
        ulcers.&nbsp;I suspect there may be some helicobacter present. Studies 
        elsewhere in the developing world have shown this not to be uncommon. 
        Some patients came to me with endoscopy reports consistent with this. I 
        was told by the nurse Amanda that&nbsp;there are&nbsp;people who vomit worms. I 
        think that treating for ascariasis is not unreasonable in selected cares 
        as the presenting complaint may be not just bloating but foul taste. 
        Giardiasis may also give indigestion. Finally think of dental pathology. 
        Our dental colleagues seem to have endless amounts of work.</span></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that parasitic infestation is ubiquitous in this 
        setting. I have seen&nbsp;laboratory studies&nbsp;brought in by patients with the 
        presence of giardiasis and amebiasis. I think the anecdotal reports of 
        passing worms argues for ascariasis. Rarely there may be other parasites 
        such as cystocercosis, but I do not think that we will diagnose this in 
        our rural clinic. I think that amebiasis seems to manifest in this 
        population as a more chronic and indolent disorder than we are used to 
        in our countries. Of course if febrile or diarrhea other bacterial or 
        inflammatory conditions are in the differential. Constipation is always 
        a possibility. Again, the diet could be better. Keep in&nbsp;mind that 
        children and menstruating or pregnant women are at greater risk of 
        anemia if afflicted with parasites. When in doubt I treat adults 
        with&nbsp;giardia or ameba&nbsp;with Tinidizole 2 grams &nbsp;once, or Metronidazole 
        500 mg TID x 1 week. Young children are more at risk from seizure with 
        Tinidizale so should receive Metronidazole dosed by size. For worms 
        consider giving adults Abendazole 400 mg once, or Mebendazole 200 mg BID 
        for three days. For children give the same in scaled down dosage. </span>
