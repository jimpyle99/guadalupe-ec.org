This modern facility is located on the grounds of a mission in the town of 
Guadalupe. In addition to examining rooms, there is an operating theater, dental 
suites, optometric services, an extensive pharmacy, and a rudimentary 
laboratory. They have also organized mobile health fairs in other remote 
underserved impoverished villages of the Oriente, the Ecuadorian Amazon. 
Volunteers have come from the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Canada, 
Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, and Ireland. There have been internists, 
pediatricians, general practitioners, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, 
emergency physicians, dentists, and a general surgeon. Nurse practitioners and 
physician assistants have attended. A German medical student and a nurse 
practitioner student from The Yale School of Nursing have rotated through this 
venue. Volunteers of all faiths have come for two weeks or for several months.
