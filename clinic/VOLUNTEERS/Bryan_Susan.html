  <h4>Volunteer Experiences</h4>
  <p class="erfahrung"><strong>ANAESTHESIA  AT CLINICA MISIONAL, GUADALUPE-ECUADOR</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>SUMMARY OF THE WORK DONE 2005</strong> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">During a 13 day stay (March 5 to March 17, 2005) at  Guadalupe Clinic I provided anaesthesia for approximately 30 patients  undergoing a variety of general surgical procedures.  I accompanied a Canadian surgeon, Dr. Dan  Mahoney, to the clinic to do this work. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I provided 19 spinal anaesthetics, 9 general anaesthetics  and 2 local anaesthetics with intravenous sedation.  The commonest surgical procedures performed  were inguinal hernia repairs with mesh, umbilical hernia repairs, and  epigastric hernia repairs.  In addition,  several minor plastic surgical procedures were completed (excision  supernumerary breasts bilateral axillae, excision large cheloids ear pinna,  excision granulomatous lesion ankle).  A  large parotid tumour was excised under endotracheal general anaesthesia.  An acute traumatic amputation of 4 fingers resulting  from a mining accident was debrided and repaired under general anaesthesia. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">No major complications resulted from the anaesthesia and  surgery provided.  One elderly male  patient with pre-existing prostatic problems was unable to void post-op  following spinal anaesthesia for hernia repair.   He required overnight urinary bladder catheterization.  The catheter was removed the next morning by  which time he was able to void freely and was discharged.  Several patients developed low grade fevers  during the first 24 hours following surgery.   Febrile patients were kept an extra day in the post-op short stay area  and received an extra day of intravenous antibiotic medications following  surgery.  No overt post-op infections  were encountered.  No other post-operative  anaesthesia complications were noted. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>PREOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Prior to our arrival in South America, the Mission made a  series of local radio announcements about the visit by a surgical team to the  clinic and invited patients to attend.   This seemed to be the best way to get the word out of the new service. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Preoperative patients were screened by the surgeon  first.  Those requiring relatively  low-risk procedures that could be performed either on an outpatient basis or in  a short stay unit (one or two nights maximum overnight stay) were selected by  the surgeon and slated into an upcoming surgical schedule over the next 10  days.  These patients were then reviewed  by myself for anaesthesia issues/risk and any preoperative testing that might  be needed (hemoglobin, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, urinalysis,  glucose and do-it-yourself EKG all available at the clinic).  A modest knowledge of medical Spanish was  essential for the anaesthetist to review these patients (only one  English/Spanish speaking nurse was available to help with translations and she  was needed most by the surgeon).  After  assessment by the surgeon and by the anaesthetist, patients were sent home with  instructions to return on the day of surgery with an empty stomach.  They were asked to shower prior to coming to  the clinic on the day of surgery, and to arrive with a relative who was willing  to stay overnight with them at the Clinic (to feed and help care for them  postoperatively).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>THE DAY OF SURGERY</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Although outpatient surgery is quite feasible for most  patients having minor operations such as hernia repairs in Canada, this  approach was not reasonable at the Guadalupe Clinic.  The Clinic is not road accessible and  therefore some patients had to walk long distances and catch several buses, or  ride a horse often for some hours to get back home after surgery.  Conditions at their homes were not ideal for  outpatient safety (no telephone, many hours from medical help, often no clean  running water).  The alternative of  having patients stay at a small hotel in the nearby village of Guadalupe was  considered, but the hotel was about half a kilometer walk from the clinic  (across a bridge over the river) and also rooms in the hotel were up three  flights of stairs which were too difficult for the patients with recent hernia  repairs to climb. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">For these reasons, all hernia repair patients were kept in  the post-operative recovery area for at least one night.  This allowed us to monitor them for fever or  other problems, to provide them with analgesic medications, and also to routinely  provide several doses of post-op intravenous antibiotics to prevent  infection.  The clinic hired a nurse to  monitor the patients in the recovery area over night and administer their  medications.  Most patients were ready  for discharge by the following morning.   Those with persistent low grade fever were kept on IV antibiotics for  more than a day.  Hernia patients were  discharged home with a small supply of Acetaminophen with Codeine tablets and a  short course of oral antibiotics. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The one room Recovery Room was a busy and congested location.  No meals are provided by the Clinic to  patients, so most patients brought a relative with them to provide food, drink,  and personal care.  On arrival on the day  of surgery patients were assigned a bed in the Recovery Room and then sent to  the shower to scrub head to toe with a Proviodine (or Chlorhexidine) surgical  scrub package.  They were provided with a  clean patient gown and an IV of 1 litre of Normal Saline was started.  Although 7 beds were present in the Recovery  Room, only 5 were accessible to patients as the other 2 were jammed in corners  (these were used by sleeping relatives of patients at night).  During the day there were usually still some  patients in beds from the previous day&rsquo;s operations (waiting for buses to ride  home, or horses to arrive) and meanwhile a new group of patients was arriving  to get showered and gowned prior to the current O.R. day.  There is a single washroom with toilet and  shower available for all these patients and relatives.  Male and female patients all share the same  room with little privacy, but seem used to such a set up and appeared quite  content and comfortable.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The operating room itself is a large clean room, quite new,  with good overhead lighting and a good mobile surgical spotlight mounted  overhead.  It has no windows, which aids  cleanliness, but consequently the room is not well ventilated and tends to get  hot and steamy.  Power supply is reliable  because the Clinic has a back-up generator which can be started reliably by the  staff whenever there is a power failure (happens quite often).  Three fully functioning steam autoclave units  are available next to the operating room area for sterilizing equipment. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>ANAESTHESIA EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Equipment available to the anesthetist at the time of my  visit is outlined below:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">1) Narkomed Compact Anaesthesia Machine  + Drager AV Ventilator and Absorber</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- I placed a photocopied &ldquo;Specifications and Equipment&rdquo;  guide and Instructions Manual for this machine (all in English) in the  anaesthesia machine drawer for future reference</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- the  &ldquo;Narcomed  Compact&rdquo; is by North American Drager Company, 148B Quarry Road, Telford,  Pennsylvania. USA. 18969.  This machine  is Drager Ave Serial #4886.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- ventilator has a hanging bellows and the machine has a  rate and volume control to adjust minute ventilation.  Volume adjustments are made manually with a  &ldquo;push-bar&rdquo; mechanism right on the bellows assembly. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- a technician from the nearby hospital in the town of  Zamora checked over and apparently serviced the anaesthesia machine a few weeks  before our visit.  Obviously there is no  one on site to service or maintain the machine regularly and this is therefore  the visiting anaesthetist&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- at the Clinic there are a number of sets of light weight  plastic anaesthesia circuit tubing for the &ldquo;circle  system&rdquo;.   There are about 7 of these sets in adult size and one set of pediatric  tubing.  These are meant to be disposable  single use sets;  however, we safely  reused them repeatedly by placing a small in-line disposable heat and moisture  exchanging filter between the circuit and the patient airway.  The small filters were discarded between each  patient.  A small supply of the filters  were left at the clinic, but any visiting anaesthetist should probably bring  along some new ones unless you plan to clean, disinfect and dry the circuit  hoses between each patient.  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">2) Oxygen Supply</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- there is no piped-in oxygen and no small back up oxygen  tanks on the yolks on the anaesthesia machine itself.  All oxygen came from large stand alone  compressed oxygen tanks (44.8 kilogram tank size) which were lined up along the  wall in the operating theater.  Six tanks  were available at the time we were there and had been brought in by truck  especially for our visit.  We used up 2  tanks during our 8 days of surgery at the site.   You must connect the anaesthesia machine to one of these tanks (2  pressure reduction valves with on-off hand turning valves and pressure guages  and a big wrench were available to connect the tanks up to the valve assemblies  and oxygen gas line going into the anaesthesia machine).  Please note that the oxygen pressure must be  turned up higher than 28 on the oxygen tank dial to have sufficient drive  pressure to run the ventilator.  Below  that pressure, the oxygen will flow through the circuit to the patient allowing  spontaneous breathing or hand bagging, but the ventilator will not function.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- one oxygen tank was moved to the Recovery Room area  temporarily for one patient who required oxygen for an hour postoperatively via  nasal prongs.  Otherwise oxygen (and  suction) are not available in the Recovery area so all patients were kept in  the operating room until awake and stable enough to go to recovery without  supplementary oxygen/suction needs.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- there is no nitrous oxide available here presently and it  was not needed (it is rarely used now at the hospital where I work in Canada  anyway).  The machine is set up to use  nitrous oxide (has a flow meter and a nitrous oxide intake line) should this  gas be required in future.  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">3) Volatile Agents – Vapourizors</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- the anaestheia machine has two vapourizors for volatile  agents.  However as no volatile agents were  available at the clinic, and purchase price of these agents is prohibitively  high in Ecuador, I did not use any volatile agents in my anaesthetics.  I was unable to transport any volatile agents  aboard the aircraft when I flew to Ecuador as they are on a list of &ldquo;Dangerous  Goods&rdquo; that the airlines will not allow on board. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- the vapourizors were both quite ancient but probably would  work (I don&rsquo;t believe they have been recently checked and calibrated  however).  They work on the direct pour  fill method (i.e. they do not fill with pin-indexed colour-coded spigots like  modern vapourizors.  You just pour the  volatile liquid directly into a small open reservoir on the side of the  vapourizor and it runs down a trough into the tank inside the vapourizor.  This obviously leaves room for deadly error  if the wrong volatile agent is put into the vapourizor chamber). </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- Halothane liquid and a Halothane vapourizor were available  at the nearby hospital in Zamora so it must be possible to obtain this volatile  agent in Ecuador.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- Vapourizor specifications were as follows:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">a) &ldquo;Isoflurane Vapor 19.1&rdquo; Serial #61146, made in Germany by  Dragerwerk AG Lubeck</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">b)  &ldquo;Enflurane Vapor  19.1&rdquo; Serial #59684, made in Germany by Dragerwerk AG Lubeck</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Because no volatile anaesthesia agents were available, I  chose to use local, or regional (spinal) anaesthetics when possible, or Total  Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) using Propofol for my general anaesthetics.  The clinic happened to have a good stock of Propofol  1% 20 ml glass vials that I could use for this purpose (however, this may not  always be the case so check on availability of this drug at the time of your  visit, or plan to bring your own).  There  is not an infusion pump available at the Clinic for giving TIVA so you should  bring your own.  I borrowed a Bard  Propofol Infusion pump for this purpose from my base hospital in Canada and  returned it to Canada at the end of my stay in Ecuador.   The pump is relatively small and portable  and easily carried in luggage.  The  anaesthesia machine was used just to ventilate patients with 100% oxygen while  the anaesthesia agents were all administered intravenously. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">If you do manage to get volatile agents in the O.R. here in  the future, be aware that there is no gas scavenging system available and that  ventilation of the operating room is not great;   therefore be prepared to be breathing some fumes if you choose to give  general anaesthetics with an inhaled volatile agent here.  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">4) Alarm Systems on the Ventilator</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- the original ventilator machine has a 60 second alarm  delay for disconnect/failure to ventilate built in to the machine</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- two further safety alarms have been added later to the  machine.  One is an audio and/or visual  alarm which alerts the anaesthetist to disconnect of the circuit or low drive  pressure in the oygen input pipe (i.e. if the oxygen tank is running out, or  not turned up high enough to drive the ventilator bellows).  The other is an audio/visual alarm which  signals:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">a) subatmospheric pressure below negative 10 cm H2O</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">b) high pressure (above 63.5 cm H2O)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">c) sustained high pressure (above 18 cm H2O for 10 seconds)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">d) automatic ventilation pressure below preset level  (frequency) for 15 seconds</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">5)  Patient Monitors</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">a) a Spacelabs model 90603A (plug-in, not portable) has the  following capabilities:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> - ECG – 5 lead – wise  to bring your own &ldquo;Red Spot&rdquo; or other monitor buttons for use with this.  It has a good view on the monitor screen and  a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; capability.  You can print out  paper strips supposedly but I was unable to get the print function to  work.  Shows the pulse rate in big  numbers on the screen.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- pressure transducers X2 for use with arterial or central  lines.  I didn&rsquo;t need these at all while  there and they likely are not something you will be wanting to set up in this  setting.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- finger pulse monitor (not an oximeter unfortunately, just  a pulse monitor) really didn&rsquo;t add any new information as ECG was already being  monitored.  This pulse monitor could be  used on the second (back up) monitor of the same make that was available for  use in the recovery room if needed.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- ports for temperature probes to be inserted X2, but no  probes available.  Not essential anyway  as basic electronic thermometers are available here. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- attached Spacelabs model 90651 automatic blood pressure  cuff.  This initially worked  intermittently when I arrived, but then the cuff tore, and then finally the BP  monitoring machine itself died.  With a  new cuff, and repairs to the automatic BP machine this could again be  functional. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Thus this main monitor at the present time is only providing  EKG pattern and a pulse rate.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">b) Blood Pressure cuffs</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- two small plug-in automatic BP cuffs were used once the  better &ldquo;Spacelabs&rdquo; automatic cuff died. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- these are plug in electrical units and would give an  automatic digital reading only when the &ldquo;start&rdquo; button was pushed.  There was no method to set them to record BP  every 3 minutes and there were no alarm functions available to alert the  anaesthetist to low or high pressure situations.  Also the hose between the patient and the  monitoring device was extremely short so the device had to be taped onto the  pillow beside the patient&rsquo;s head in order to reach down to their arm.  Still these units did the job and seemed to  give reliable readings (as long as someone remembered to push the button and  look at the result every 3 minutes)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- numerous manual BP cuffs and stethoscopes were available,  including one pediatric sized cuff suitable for 1 to 5 year old children</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- no automatic pediatric BP cuff was available</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">c) Pulse oximeter</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- one only battery operated stand-alone finger probe was  available.  No ear probes.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- the unit worked well, but had only visual and no audio  function.  Therefore the anaesthetist had  to remember to look at the small digital screen right on the probe itself every  few minutes to check the patient&rsquo;s oxygen saturation.  As the patient&rsquo;s finger was often down under  the drapes somewhere out of view this was not a very convenient method of  watching oxygen levels, and certainly with no audio function or alarms on it,  the usual auditory clues of a dropping oxygen level were not present.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- an advantage of this small unit was that it could go with  the patient to recovery room and remain on them there for a half hour or so  post-op until it was needed again in the operating room for the next patient</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">d) No end-tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor available.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">6)  Crash Cart</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- a crash cart containing a variety of emergency  medications, an ambu bag, face masks, oral airways, endotracheal tubes,  intravenous catheters</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- adult laryngoscope with standard sized MacIntosh blade and  also a set of straight blades including two different pediatric sized straight  blades</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- no ECG monitor on the crash cart .  You would need to hook the patient up to the  Spacelabs monitor on the anaesthesia machine, or to the electrocardiogram  machine to get a view of the hear rythm. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- several defibrillators at the Clinic, but none of them  working at all (lights won&rsquo;t even come on when plugged in). </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">7)  Intravenous  supplies</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- a good supply of 1 liter intravenous fluid bags and intravenous  catheters, 5 IV poles</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- a few central line kits should these be needed in an  emergency</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- a few bags of volume expanders (Pentaspan, Hetastarch)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- no transfusion capacity here</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- no fluid warmers or pressure pumps for infusing volume  rapidly</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- one patient warming blanket (hardly needed in this  climate!!!!)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">8)  Suction</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- no wall suction</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">- two portable plug-in electrical suction pumps in OR (one  for anaesthesia and one for surgeon) with modest suction ability.  These have washable reusable 1.3 litre glass  suction bottles on them and are called Schuco Vac by Airco-Ohio Medical. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">9)  Drugs/Anaestheia  Equipment</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">In general, the Clinic has a well-stocked general pharmacy,  but visiting anaesthetists should check on the current availability of  anaesthesia drugs as these are often not there at all, or are in short  supply.  Many of the drugs are now  out-dated but for most uses, this probably doesn&rsquo;t matter much.  You should plan to bring most of what you  need with you.   This includes drugs (particularly  muscle relaxants, neostigmine, glycopyrrolate, midazolam, propofol) and  specific disposable anaesthesia equipment (spinal needles, endotracheal tubes,  sterile gloves, any special sized needles or syringes). .  Muscle relaxants in particular are hard to  come by, expensive for the clinic, and out-date quickly so you should bring  lots with you.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> The Clinic has  suitable sharps disposal containers (all sharps are then burned and buried in a  deep well with metal cover outside the Clinic).   Disposable drapes, bloody sponges, body parts, etc. are incinerated in a  small outdoor incinerator.  Pathological  specimens are generally not sent off for examination unless it is important to  have a specific diagnosis.  We did send  one tumour off to be examined, but apparently results are not easily or  reliably obtained.  Specimens seem to go  astray sometimes. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">This is a very pleasant and safe place to visit and to  work.  Accomodation for visiting  physicians is terrific.  Meals are all  provided and are delicious.  The setting  is truly beautiful and there are excellent opportunities for hiking,  bird-watching, and visiting interesting little villages that are far off the  beaten track.  There are no tourists  here.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The medical facility is generally clean and modern by  Ecuadorian standards.  Staff at the  Clinic are very helpful and anxious to facilitate your work there.  They appear to have a strong network of  support providing a steady stream of supplies, drugs, equipment, and personel  from abroad.  The local people are  friendly and appreciate the care provided.   The surgery provided at this Clinic is really filling a need for these  people as there are few other options available to them that are affordable and  geographically near. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Our visit here was the first attempt to provide general  surgical and anaesthesia services at this site.   I would say it was most successful and I would feel confident in going  there again to do the same sort of work.   </p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> <br />
		Anaesthesia wish list:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Some sort of monitor that includes hopefully all the usually  required modalities that anaesthetists monitor during anaesthesia all in one  machine. This would therefore have:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">a) pulse oximetry with continuous both audio and visual read  out of the result as well as alarms that can be set on the oximeter to ring if  the value is too low, pulse too slow or too fast</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">b) electrocardiogram continuous monitor (with ability to  print out a rhythm strip if possible but this printing function is not a basic  necessity)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">c) an automatic blood pressure cuff with several sizes of  cuffs (2 adult sizes and one or two pediatric sizes) which can be set to cycle  on a regular time frame (every 3 minutes for example) and which can be set to  alarm if the blood pressure is too high or too low. The results of the blood  pressure reading should appear on the monitor screen</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">d) an end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor that can be put in  the patient circuit to monitor the end-tidal carbon dioxide levels of the  patient</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The present monitor only offers (b) above at present, and  will not print out a rhthym strip. If you cannot get a monitor that offers all  of the above functions, then top priority should be (a) the pulse oximeter with  audio and visual continuous monitoring capacity. Second priority should be (c)  the automatic blood pressure cuff. So far I have managed completely without (d)  and managed well enough, but it is usually a standard monitor that is used in  anaesthesia. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Furthermore:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">A vapourizor of some sort (?Halothane, or preferably Sevoflurane)  for which you would need to have a modest stock of the appropriate volatile  agent. There is no use having the vapourizor if the agent is unavailable. Also  the vapourizor would have to be installed on your anaesthesia machine. This  vapourizor probably would not be used very often, as intravenous anaesthesia  agents are likely simpler and cheaper to use in your setting. However the  volatile agents are generally preferred for small children and infants. Also  there may be some anaesthetists who simply are unfamiliar with total  intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) techniques and are only comfortable using  inhaled anaesthetic agents. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">A peripheral nerve stimulator (used by anaesthetist to  determine the degree of muscle paralysis following a dose of muscle relaxant). </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">A defibrillator for the crash cart that actually works - you  have several machines there but none of them seem to be working at the moment.<br />

	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>Experience of the medical brigade en March 2006</strong> </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">During the two weeks of my stay in Guadalupe in March  2006,  I gave anaesthesia for about 40  operations performed by Dr. Dan Mahoney, a General Surgeon from Chatham,  Ontario in Canada.  This was my second 2  week visit to the Clinic to give anaesthesia. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The commonest procedure we did was hernia repairs (inguinal,  umbilical, ventral, epigastric), often with mesh repairs.  We also removed several parotid gland  tumours, some lumps and bumps, incision and drainage abcesses, repair of a  traumatic hand amputation, one full mouth dental extractions on a small  child.  The biggest cases we performed  were this year when we did two open cholecystectomies (there is no laparoscope  there). The gallbaldders were done under full general anaesthesia with  narcotic, muscle relaxants, and IV Propofol infusion using an infusion  pump.   I did all the inguinal hernias,  other than small children,  under spinal  anaesthesia.  The small children I did  under general anaesthesia using a Propofol infusion pump.  The upper abdominal hernias were done under  local anaestheisia with IV sedation   (Versed or low dose Propofol infusion), or full general anaesthesia  using Propofol infusion, intravenous narcotics and Rocuronium as a muscle  relaxant where needed for the large hernias. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">There are no inhaled agents available at the clinic.  They have vaporizors on the anaesthesia  machine but no volatile agents available.   If you are able to bring some volatile agents with you (Forane, Ethrane)  you could use these I presume, but I was unable to bring these agents aboard  the airplane as they are on the list of dangerous/prohibited products for air  transport.  There is no nitrous oxide on  the anaesthesia machine, and no air mix available.  Therefore all general anaestheisa was done  with 100% oxygen plus IV drugs.  The  oxygen comes in huge tanks bolted to the wall and is used not only for the  patient to breathe, but also to drive the ventilator bellows.  There is no gas scavenging system, but as  there are no gases except oxygen, it really doesn't matter.  If you look at the information I have posted  on the web page from my visit last year you will have all the particulars on  the gas machine and monitors that were available at that time.  I left an instruction manual (photocopy  obtained from the company) for the machine in the drawer of the anaesthesia  machine.  The clinic has since improved  their monitoring capabilities and has two automatic blood pressure cuffs  (although they are only &quot;automatic&quot; if you push the start button -  they will not cycle every 3 minutes).   They also have a new pulse oximeter which works quite well, two  functioning EKG machines which will print out a strip or full cardiogram with  interpretation, and also an EKG monitor on the anaesthesia machine itself. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">They have improved the physical space by installing a  dehumidifier in the operating room which makes it much easier to work  comfortably without dripping sweat on the patient wound, and also an exhaust  fan in the sterilizer room which has cut the steaminess considerably.  They also have installed curtains between the  6 hospital beds in the overnight ward room so there is some privacy for the  patients.  The Clinic managed to provide  a nurse to stay with the patients overnight although this was a bit of a  challenge at times, with Amanda having to fill in a lot of the night shifts  herself while still working all day as well.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We initially had planned to do outpatient surgery for the  hernias, but on seeing the living conditions of many of the patients (living  miles away up mountainsides, having to return home on horseback or hours on the  bus, no clean running water or electricity in the homes, miles from any medical  help in the case of any emergency), we decided to keep all the patients  overnight at least one night.  The  gallbladder patients we did on a Friday so they could stay over the weekend and  be discharged out by Monday morning to make room for Monday's incoming  patients.  We generally did 4 or 5  procedures per day and that kept the inpatient room full all the time.  We ran IV fluids on all the patients for the  first 12 hours or so to hydrate them and give a route for 3 doses of IV  antibiotics (one intraop and then 2 further IV doses post-op).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">It is a great place to work and the people are very  helpful.  You should be able to provide safe  anaesthesia there for minor to medium degree surgery including pediatric cases  down to about 3 or 4 years of age I would say. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Please don't hesitat to write me with further questions.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung"> </p>
	<hr />
	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>Anaesthesia Experience at Guadalupe Clinic, March 2007</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">For the third year in a row I worked as a volunteer  anaesthetist with a Canadian general surgeon (Dr. Dan Mahoney) at the Mission  Clinic at Guadalupe, Ecuador. During our two week visit we completed  approximately 35 major cases (requiring spinal or general anaesthesia and  overnight admission) in additional to several minor outpatient procedures under  local anaesthesia. Hernia repairs (inguinal, ventral, femoral and epigastric)  were the commonest procedure done. A number of these were repaired with mesh.  Several anal fistulas were repaired, and a number of lumps and masses were  removed. One open cholecystectomy was completed at Guadalupe Clinic, and 5  laparoscopic cholecystectomies were done at the hospital in Zamora (public  hospital located about one hour away by car) by our team. The oldest patient  operated on was 83 and the youngest, a child of 4 years. No serious anaesthetic  or surgical complications occurred, including no significant postoperative  infections. With this third year of surgery, our team has completed over 100  general surgical procedures under anaesthesia at this location without any  significant complications.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Anaesthesia equipment and methods used were outlined in  previous summaries of our visits to the Clinic. However, there were some  significant improvements in equipment available this year. The anaesthesia  machine is now equipped with a new monitor which records automatic blood  pressure readings, pulse oximetry, pulse rate and continuous EKG. There is a  second plug-in pulse oximeter and pulse monitor available should it be required  in the post-op care unit, as well as a small battery operated mobile pulse  oximeter for use by nursing staff in postoperative care. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Another improvement is the new piped in wall suction  available. The unit is run through a compressor on the roof of the clinic which  provides suction to the dental rooms and also two separate suction lines to the  operating room. One line can be used by the surgeon for intraoperative  suctioning of blood or fluids. The second line can be connected directly to the  canisters on the back of the anaesthesia machine to provide suction at the head  of the bed for the anaesthetist. In addition, there is still an electrically  driven suction with cleanable glass bottles which can be plugged in if required  as a back up. A minor caution – the compressor on the roof tends to heat up a  lot and therefore staff usually turn it off over lunch hour and late in the  afternoon when the dentists are finished working. A reminder may be needed to  the Clinic staff not to turn off the suction compressor while  surgery/anaesthesia is ongoing in the operating room. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Anaesthesia and Surgery in Zamora Hospital (which is NOT the  Mission Clinic of Guadalupe)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">For the first time our team decided to do some surgery in  the community hospital in Zamora (about an hour by car away). This was arranged  because there were many patients requiring gallbladder surgery who would  benefit from having laparoscopic rather than open cholecystectomy. The Zamora  Hospital has a full set of laparoscopic equipment (CO2 insufflator, television  monitor screen, laparoscopic camera and laparoscopic instruments) but  unfortunately the surgeons at the hospital have not received training in use of  these instruments yet, and therefore the equipment is not used. Also the Zamora  Hospital was able to provide overnight nursing care for our patients. We  successfully completed 5 laparoscopic cholecystectomies at the Zamora Hospital.  All patients were able to go home the day following surgery. We also elected to  do one massive recurrent incisional hernia repair as an inpatient at the Zamora  Hospital as this lady needed a prolonged inpatient admission following her  surgery and this would have tied up our limited beds available at the Clinic.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The anaesthesia equipment available at Zamora Hospital was  in reasonable shape but a few cautions are needed. The anaesthesia machine is  fairly modern, but the ventilator on the machine is broken. A technician apparently  has already tried to fix it without success. Therefore it was necessary to  manually &ldquo;bag&rdquo; the patients throughout the operations. This ties up the  anaesthetist all the time, and for that reason it is preferable to bring along  an anaesthesia assistant to do most of the manual bagging of the patients so  that the anaesthetist is able to draw up drugs, change intravenous bags, etc.  during the surgery. The machine has vapourizors for Sevoflurane and Halothane.  I used the Sevoflurane as my primary anaesthetic agent for some of the cases  and did the others using a Propofol infusion pump (which I brought with me –  not available at the Zamora Hospital). There is no piped in oxygen. It is  necessary to crank on the large tank of oxygen mounted on the wall of the room  to turn on the oxygen source. There is no nitrous oxide or tanks of compressed  air to mix with the oxygen, so all anaesthetics are given using 100% oxygen.  They have an EKG monitor, automatic BP cuff, and oximeter, but the end-tidal  carbon dioxide monitor and agent analyser were not working. Suction was fine.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The electricity is not reliable. The power went off for some  hours while we were there and a hospital back-up generator came on promptly  enough. However, once the generator was on, we kept having trouble with the  laparoscopic equipment and anaesthesia equipment &ldquo;cutting out&rdquo;as a result of  the irregular power source coming from the generator. All the equipment was  plugged in through &ldquo;surge protector&rdquo; boxes. These boxes kept causing all the  electronic equipment to turn off in response to surges of power from the  generator. In the end, we ended up taking the surge protectors out of some of  the circuits and plugging the equipment directly into the wall outlets so that  it didn&rsquo;t keep turning on and off in the middle of the operation.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">You should plan to bring all your own anaesthesia equipment  and drugs with you to Zamora. This way you will be assured of having what you  need, and it will certainly save the patient an expense. Otherwise you will  have to go to the hospital store (part of the hospital, located near the  Emergency Room) and buy each syringe, needle, IV bag, drug, endotracheal tube,  IV administration set, bladder catheters, tape etc. from the store. This cost  is usually charged to the patient if they are having surgery at the hospital.  The store sells Sevoflurane and Halothane either in small plastic containers  (about 30 mls) or by the 250 ml. bottle (about $225 each). If you are operating  on a number of patients it is much cheaper to buy a full bottle of inhaled  agent and leave the unused portion at the Clinic for the next surgeon to use.  If you are able to bring a bottle of Sevoflurane with you to Ecuador (not  usually a permitted substance on aircraft however) this would certainly save  the Clinic patients a big expense. If you are doing laparoscopic surgery, you  need to bring your own surgical clips with you, or you can buy them in packs of  10 at the hospital store. Another caution – when we first visited the store we  were told by the person in charge there that it was always open, so that if we  needed anything in a hurry during the surgery, we could just send someone down  to the store to get it. In fact, the next two times we went to the store there  was no one there and it was locked up. Therefore it is likely a good idea to  get all your equipment and drugs together before you start a case, because  supplies may not be reliably available through the store when you suddenly need  them.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">There is no recovery room. Patients must be well enough to  go directly back to the ward following surgery, so you may wish to wait for  awhile in the operating room with any patient who may have airway difficulties  or be excessively drowsy. Oxygen prongs are generally available at the bedside  on the ward if needed in the immediate post-op period, but monitoring is  limited to pulse, blood pressure and temperature in the post-op ward. Each  patient going to the ward postoperatively at the hospital must have their own  supply of medications (narcotics, anti-emetics, pain pills, IV antibiotics,  needles, syringes, alcohol swabs, dressings for dressing changes, IV bags,  etc). Usually the patients keep these supplies in a drawer next to the bedside  and the nurse administers them to the patient as directed in your physician&rsquo;s  post-op orders. Another hint – write your post op orders in Spanish and use  both the generic and the brand name of each drug to try to avoid problems for  the nursing staff in following the post-op orders. It is best to leave an exact  supply of each needle, syringe and medication required for the care of your  patient in the bedside table and count out the supplies with the nurse and a  relative if possible to make sure there is enough of each item. If you don&rsquo;t  leave enough supplies, your patient just won&rsquo;t receive the medications you have  ordered.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Operating room staff at the Zamora Hospital were helpful and  knowledgeable, even though they rarely have done laparoscopic surgery. Surgical  instruments were chemically sterilized by the staff in Cidex and rinsed with sterile  saline prior to use. Sterile cloth surgical drapes were provided. Several local  surgeons were helpful in assisting at the operations. </p>

	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>General Surgery at Guadalupe Clinic - March 2008</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Once again a team from Canada consisting of Dr. Dan Mahoney  (General Surgeon) and Dr. Susan Bryan (Anaesthetist) plus three able helpers  (Jeremy Bryan, Mike Bryan and Zack Mahoney) provided general surgical services  at the Clinic Hospital for a period of 10 days. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Approximately 40 procedures were undertaken under general  anaesthesia, spinal anaesthesia, or local anaesthesia with sedation. The most  commonly completed surgeries were hernia repairs (inguinal, femoral, umbilical  and ventral).  A variety of other minor  procedures included debridement and suture of a machete wound, removal of  gunshot pellets from an arm, removal of supernumerary fingers, and excision of  an olecranon bursa.  No serious  complications were encountered.  Patients  having more major procedures such as hernia repairs stayed in a temporary ward  at the Clinic for one night following surgery.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">There were a number of improvements at the Clinic since our  last visit a year ago.  This year we  enjoyed cooler operating conditions in the O.R. theatre thanks to the newly  installed air conditioner.  A larger new  steam sterilizer was a great help in preparing all the sterilized instrument  trays required.  We were pleased to stay in  the newly built family apartment complex located in the nearby village.  This was constructed by the Mission to  provide comfortable housing for visiting volunteers.</p>

	<p class="erfahrung"><strong>Surgical Visit to Guadalupe Clinic – January 23 until  February 4, 2011</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Surgeon – Dr. Dan Mahoney (Chatham, Ontario, CANADA)<br />
		Anaesthetist – Dr. Susan Bryan (Thunder bay, Ontario,  CANADA)<br />
		Other team members – Volunteers Zack Mahoney, Rachel Bryan  and Jeremy Bryan<br />
		<br />
		This was the fifth visit by this team of Canadians to the  Guadalupe Clinic.  The Clinic provided  substantial publicity in advance of our visit in the form of radio  advertisements and posters throughout the region.  The advertising was directed particularly to  patients with hernias requiring repair and those with skin lesions, or lumps  requiring removal.  As in years past  consultations with a surgeon were provided and a number of minor surgical procedures  were undertaken. <br />
		<br />
		The commonest surgical procedure undertaken was hernia  repair.  Inguinal, umbilical and  ventral/epigatric hernia repairs were performed generally on a one night stay  inpatient basis.  A number of very large  hernias, and also recurrent hernias were repaired usually with mesh.  Anaesthesia was most commonly spinal but  regional infiltration with local anaesthesia and also general anaesthesia was  administered in about a third of the patients where appropriate for the  procedure.  Patients were all well enough  to leave the Clinic the day after surgery and were seen in follow up a week or  two later. <br />
		<br />
		Generally 4 operations per day were undertaken.  A total of 35 procedures were successfully  completed in the 10 day visit.  Patients  received a bolus of high dose intravenous antibiotics on induction of  anaesthesia.  This appears to have  successfully prevented any postoperative infections.  No serious complications were encountered.</p>
