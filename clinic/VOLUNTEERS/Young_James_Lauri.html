  <h4>Volunteer Experiences</h4>
  <p class="erfahrung"><!--end div class="volexperience" --><strong>Nangaritza Experience 2006</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">By now you all know that we made it out of the jungle and  have already experienced our first civilized frustration with sending an  internet account last night.  So here we  go again...you will be getting two accounts.   One will be from Jim and the other from me.  Here is Jim's   Remember, these are our journal...so if you have no time remember the  location of the delete button.  We thank  you all for your good wishes!!</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We have returned safely from our all expense paid jungle  adventure, only slightly worse for the wear (a cracked rib for me and GI  distress for Lauri).  Sunday (April 23)  we awoke to pouring rain, finished our packing, and breakfast as our driver  arrived.  We hauled all our bags of meds,  equipment and a daypack of personal items to the taxi (a pick-up truck) and  headed off...a 3 hr. ride (only 15 minutes on paved surface) to the end of the  road and the boat dock.  In typical EC  fashion, the rest of the group then discovered they had forgotten to pick-up  the nurse (who could certainly have been left behind).  So, the taxi returned to Guayzimi, a 2 hr.  round trip while we ate lunch in a small cafe (very Ecuadorian).  By the time they returned and the ambulance  boat was loaded, it was 1 pm as we started up the river against a pretty strong  current.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Initially the river coursed through steep canyon walls with  moss covered rock and an occasional waterfall.   This was very pretty.  Aside from  the current, travel seemed not too difficult at the start (that would change  drastically) except for some serious rain at times (Amazon style) --  fortunately Padre had loaned us a couple of ponchos and the boat was roofed, so  we stayed pretty dry.  But... more about  the boat.  It was a long, narrow steel  affair with seats for about 6 people and we were 10.  The rest sat on bags or stood.  It was powered by a 60 hp outboard.  Since it was the river ambulance, it had an  army-like stretcher strapped to the roof and folding supports on one side to  attach the handles.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">After 1 hr. in the water, we stopped at a village to pick up  the Ec Doctor (another waste) and more med supplies and headed on.  A short distance later, we reached a military  post (we were on the border with Peru and in what had been the disputed treaty  area until about 5 years ago) and stopped for a visit (no apparent reason, we  thought).  Then ensued the first of many  discussions between the two young women (health providers) and the boat driver  about where we were planning to spend the night.  It turned out that one of them had a  boyfriend at the base and wanted to stay...hours from where we needed  to work the next day.  They were very willing to tell the villages  that we couldn't get there!  Fortunately,  Amanda the bilingual nurse from Guadalupe was able to translate all these  discussions as well as putting in her-our opinions.  Also they said they had not brought blankets  for this 4 day trip!</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Finally, we pushed on, all the while losing valuable  daylight and then the going got rough with shallow water.  We started with the two young men up front  using poles and jumping out periodically to push and pull the boat.  Finally, they let me do the same.  We were all wearing rubber boots which  reached almost to the knees but they are really to protect your feet, not keep  you dry.  The process involved pulling  and pushing the boat sometimes with passengers and occasionally with them  walking along the river or through on the jungle path which ran along side the  edge while we moved the boat.  Each time  I crawled back aboard, I emptied the boots and rung out my socks....why, I'm  not sure, since my feet stayed wet for 3 days.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">By 5:30 we reached Nuevo Paraiso, a small barrio and after  another discussion they elected to stay for the night while the driver would  take the boat around a shallow area and be ready for the morning.  (This village was on our schedule, but for 36  hours later).  The drug bags were left on  the boat and we carried food plus our knapsacks up the hill to the village ...a  15 minute walk.  Again, after some  discussion, they opened the school (a two room affair with a bathroom and  plugged toilet with no water).  These  schools have windows with bars but never glass.   It was pitch dark by 6:30, but the village had electricity so we had  lights as we set up for the night...a thin mattress on the cement floor.  We had each brought a blanket and sheet in  our packs.  We ate the lunch we had been  given earlier in the day, turned off the light to reduce the bugs flying in,  and slept with our clothes  and jackets  on (the first to three nights).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I think we were asleep by 8:30 and actually slept pretty  well until about 5:45 am when the driver stuck his face through the bars and  announced &quot;Buenos dias&quot;...the boat was ready.  Since we wee to return that night, we carried  our personal packs (were unwilling to leave them) and headed down a very muddy  path to the river on the other side of the village and headed off.  To our surprise, we were served hot chocolate  and a roll as we headed up river.  After  a short ride, we stopped for a &quot;house   call&quot; to see a 15 yr. old girl, two months pregnant with reported  nausea and vomiting.  We climbed the hill  to the house and both the EC doc and I examined this young woman with crampy  abdominal and back pain .. a pretty much normal exam.  So probably it was musculoskeletal, but later  that night I wondered if we could have missed an ectopic )a fatal disease out  there).  I happened to have a bottle  Aleve in my knapsack, so gave her a few and off we went again.  After about 3 hours of pushing and pulling  the boat, we were off loaded on a jungle path and a good 30 minute walk to the  village of Yawi.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Rather than setting to work in their health center (lots of  dirt, toilet without water, some dirty chairs etc...the health personnel had  abandoned their post years ago)  we were  welcomed with breakfast.... chicken soup with yucca (not bad).  Finally, we got to work.  I saw 30 people in probably 4 hrs with Lauri  and Amanda's help - most needing parasite and giardia meds while the EC doc saw  another 20 (hew said).  After finishing,  we had to eat again - chicken and rice with yucca again.  Back to the boat which had come all the way  to the village and off we went - this time down stream, running the rapids and  bouncing over rocks.  This is when, while  rounding a fast corner, we crashed into an unseen rock which flung me against  the edge of the boat and I was sure I had cracked a rib.  We then stopped the barrio of Yayu and helped  the Ec doctor see 10 kids to speed the process so we could get back before  dark.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">After another trap through the mud, we were back in Nuevo  Paraiso and it was quickly dark.   Remember, we are very close the Equator here.  This night the power went out about 7 pm for  an hour or so after which we were called to dinner in a house - chicken again  with rice while other chickens wandered in and out.  The entire cooking area was lit only with  candles and hulled corn was piled behind the table for grinding later - quite a  sight!  As the Ecuadorians are shorter, I  couldn't fully stand in the house.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We expected another good night of sleep, but it wasn't to be  had.  First of all, bats kept flying  through the room all night, then someone's radio started playing booming Latin  music around 4:30 or 5 am and , of course the dogs and roosters started in.  Sometimes lack of electricity is a good thing!  With being up at 6 am, I somehow thought we  could get started seeing patients there by 8 am...but no way.  We finally, after setting up in two different  places, we got started around 8:30 or 9 and then had to break for breakfast  (same house) of rice with a fried egg on top.   We then worked straight through to 2 pm seeing 30-40 people (meanwhile  the EC doc saw maybe 10 and was no where to be seen after noon or earlier.  Did I mention that there were 5 bats flying  around the exam room while we examined the cutest 8 mo. old twins.  We also discovered the health center (right  next to the school) actually had a toilet that worked (of course locked the  first 36 hours we were there).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">By 2:30 we had the boat loaded and headed on down river  running rapids all the way until we reached the military base again where two  rivers joined.  Then, of course, another  discussion followed due to the fact that the driver didn't want to go up the  other river (saying it was too low and he wanted to go home to a nearby  village).  Fortunately, the director of  the program which had actually invited our involvement had joined up earlier  that day and would have none of this.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Finally we went up the other river with the driver seemingly  choosing bad routes and frequently trying all he could to convince us he could  go no further.  Again, we pulled and  pushed the damned boat through rapids after rapids - can't count the number  while the EC doc sat on his ass or walked with the women when we unloaded.  AT one point they walked across the river  while holding hands to provide stability against the fast current.  By 5:30 it seemed like we should be getting  close to our destination..but oh no.   Another hour of pushing/pulling/walking and now it was really getting  dark.  It was very hard to see anything  in the water and we were definitely getting nervous.  The landing was made at 6:50 pm.  We could see some faint light in the distance  and thought the nard part was no over ---wrong!</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">In the pitch black, we then climbed up a 45 degree hill in  mud up to our ankles with packs and flashlights.  Not all of us had lights so our progress was  rather like an inch worm..one person with alight would go ahead a ways, stop  light the area for the next one, then go ahead etc.  All the way I was thinking that I was going  to topple over backwards and slide all the way down.  It was about this time that I was using every  expletive I've ever learned multiple times.   By the time I had fallen once on my sore rib and finally reached the  top, I was furious with this entire project.   So began the night to remember...</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">By flashlight we were guided to one of the 13 houses in the  community .. our lodging and dining location for the night.  This very simple house of rough-sawed lumber  had 1 1-2 floors with an open middle where there was a hammock and  table...everything lit by candlelight - no electricity.  We were shown a room in which to change  clothes(I was wet to nearly my waist from the river) and then waited for dinner  to be fixed - this time rice and some kind of meat none of us recognized  (turned out to be a yamala - a tapir like wild animal.  Hope it isn't endangered!).  It was pretty good except that Lauri and I  had just about reached our limit with eating rice.  I should mention that every effort was made  to keep our food uninfected and we had bottled water.  Everything was cooked except some fresh  apples although the dishes were washed with water flowing down the mountain. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I forgot to mention the place we washed off all the mud...a  constantly running hose in the middle of the open central area - also were all  the dishes and clothes were washed and people bathed when not in the  river.  The special pleasant memory of  the evening was sitting by a bonfire and the fantastic display of stars - could  nearly reach out and touch them.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Amanda, Lauri and I were then shown to our sleeping space  upstairs along a very narrow stairway outside the house to a small room with a  bed (no mattress) but a thin pad) and floor space for Amanda.  All the while we were all thinking how we  could manage the stairs during the night in the pitch black...there was no  visible latrine anywhere.  Thank heavens  the flashlight batteries still worked.   Sleep for the 3rd night in the same clothes was fitful at best with  either the pigs oinking or having trouble getting comfortable (ribs sore on one  side and hip on the other  or bladder  calls).  We were up  before first light as the sharpening of  machete blades on the stone along side the house was in full swing.   I was hoping for an early start  (did I mention that I-m a slow learner????)</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Finally started seeing patients in the school and then had  to break for breakfast (rice toped with a fried egg again and plantenos).  First we saw all the school kids and their  teacher and then started on the rest of the community..very gracious people  most of whom needed parasite, giardia and pain pills for back or head  pain.  This day the EC doc did nothing  (said there were no sick children)...actually he did see about 9 kids I was  told while we saw 60 and finally finished about 3 pm by which time I was  furious again ...not with the people but with this idiot doc and nurse (Dr. Do  Little and Nurse Do nothing.  Actually, I  have different titles, but Lauri won't allow me to use them here).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We loaded our gear, went back down the muddy hill (could now  see where we were going  WOW!!! - maybe  it was better to do it in the dark) and there the rest were cooling their heels  with a swim in the river.  By now I had  resolved never to work an EC doc again or to return with similar conditions  (lack of clarity of who had the authority to make decisions etc) but we did  good work.  The Director (Sonia) was  really trying to make things better, but she was and still is fighting an  uphill battle.  We later learned that she  had asked for the Jornanda from the clinic because she was well aware that the  EC docs didn't work hard.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The ride back down the river was as exciting as ever..but no  more cracked ribs.  We dropped off the  doc (good riddance) at Shaime and they then took us to a jungle hotel run by a  young Swedish man and his EC wife...no electricity, but nice beds, a shower  (cold) and great food.  How about Swedish  meatballs in the jungle?  Our night was  interrupted with an Amazonian rainstorm on our metal roof and occasional sprays  of water on my face but we at least had a working bathroom.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">It's now Thursday morning and we headed back upriver to our  final community..with all of the rain, we were treated to multiple  waterfalls.  And, at breakfast, the  proprietor pointed out a white throated toucan nearby in a tree (one of 2 or 3  species near the hotel).  This day I  thought the going would be easier, but wrong again.  No boat pushing, but after landing with our  supplies, we walked nearly one hour through mud and water and across logs which  literally felt at times like walking on pads of butter. Everything was slippery  with the rain.  Oh, we were also climbing  most of the time.  About 15 minutes from  the village, Lauri slipped off a log bridge and landed in waist deep water  (after an entire month, the first time the camera was NOT in a plastic bag, but  fortunately it stayed dry).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">This community, Miazi,   looked better.  The inhabitants  were Saraguro primarily while the others had been Shuar.  It had an outhouse with a flush toilet in the  center of the open area, and were building more and the school had evidence of  projects completed and a teacher who cared about the kids.  We worked straight through again and saw  about 45 kids and adults by 2:15...same who really needed attention for skin  problems and parasites.  One mom  described worms crawling out of two of her kids noses or mouths while they  slept (Ascaris).</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We wrapped our gear and headed back across the swamp ..were  dripping wet from sweat by the time we reached the boat.  A quick stop at a waterfall for photos and to  watch Darwin (a young EC man who was shooting a video) demonstrate vine  swinging.  We WISELY turned this  opportunity down!  We were then back at  the hotel around 4Ñ30 and served a traditional Shuar meal of fresh tilapia  (steamed in leaves).  It would have been  better if both of us were feeling better GI wise.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">A 3 hr. pickup ride over way too curvy roads and we were  back at the mission...none too early (8 pm).   Walking across the hanging bridge while once again carrying our medicine  packs, seemed almost like coming home.   After hot showers, we spent the rest of the evening regaling the other  volunteers and padre about the week's events and were able to laugh at the  experience.  Amanda did say that this  Jornada was the most difficult she had been on!&quot;  We did a load of clothes, tumbled into bed  and slept at least somewhat better than we had for 4 nights.  Friday morning we spent packing and relaxing.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We said our final goodbyes after lunch (the Germans were  great to live and work with) and the Padre took us to Zamora where we caught  the bus to Loja and on Saturday the plane to Quito.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Jim  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Sunday morning thoughts...after reviewing these all night  long (rather than sleeping) perhaps the best way to deal with them is to pass  them on.  So here goes. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">My feeling about this past week was that it would have been  difficult but could have been much better had the organization been  better.  There is a feeding program in  these remote villages where women are paid a small amount to basically run  provide child care for the youngest children while the parents work.  This is so they aren't left alone or in the  care of children not that much older than they are.  They are to receive supplementary food weekly  and part of what we were supposedly doing was dropping of these food  &quot;packets&quot;.  This was the young  women´s responsibility...although as Jim said, they seemed very willing to just  decide not to go places and blame it on what ever.  They were not technically part of the medical  team, but due to the joint purpose of the group no one had authority until the  director showed up.  A major problem.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The communities are a long ways from anywhere.  Amanda had never been this far up river  and  none of us had a way of judging what  was possible.  We were totally dependent  on the boat driver, basically.  The  communities were predominately Shuar, among the poorest of the indigenous  groups with a lower commitment to education.   The teacher shows up in the community when ever...no wonder the schools  looked sooo bad.  I did see one craft  project in a corner, however, scale models of hand carved dug out canoes!.  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">How we worked:  Jim  and Amanda sat close together with a chair for the patient receiving the  consultation.  I sat off to the side  surrounded by plastic bags filled with all kinds of medications.  We had been told that we should be prepared  to see around 500 patients and our responsibility was to see the children in  this nutrition program.  The EC doc. was  to see the adults but use our meds.  Of  course this didn't happen.,..so we ended up hauling more meds than needed.  Once the problems were identified, Jim would  say what we needed to treat and I would get them out of the bags, write out the  instructions - in Spanish, of course- and Amanda would do the  explanations.  After about 20 just  hearing the problems was enough for me to get the meds ready.  Sitting on the little benches with grown up  seats (ours) gave us another source of discomfort.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Those of you who wish to be free of Hippa (the government  privacy act) need to come here.  There  was a constant stream of people in and out of the door until we found ways of  propping it shut, but this didn't cut down on the line of people peering  inthrough the iron grate windows.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I wish you could have seen and I could have caught on a  photo the children who would sit and rub Jim's arm while he talked with them  and/or their mother.  The Ecuadorian men  do not have hairy arms and they petted Jim rather like one would pet a  dog.  A cute picture!</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">When we arrived in a village very few people would be  around, but before long there was a child explosion.  Unbelievable how many children women had -  sometimes as many as 7 or 8 and many young women of 22 or 23 had 4  children.  I have a MAJOR bone to pick  with the Catholic church's teaching on birth control. It is a terrible  situation - very cultural.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I am also haunted by the people we couldn't help.  A father telling us about his 16 year old son  with osteomylitis (bone infection) who could no longer walk and now had pus  coming out of his arm.  He was about 20  minutes away from where we were and we didn't have time to walk there,,,,but  then we had no appropriate meds to use anyway.   He had been treated in a hospital in the past but we don't know if he  had completed a course of therapy due to the expense.  Now of course who knows...  There was also the young mother with 15 mo  old and  pregnant who told us she was  having headaches because her husband got drunk and then beat her.  And the 12 year old who sat and cried as we  talked with her because her drunk father beat her mother regularly.  All of us were tearing as we listened and had  nothing we could do except ask her teacher to help.  She had no other family in the community, her  mother wasn´t with her...there is no support system for family violence and it  is a big problem here.  As for women who  have a difficult delivery...well, they die.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The jungle was green, green and had vines galore.  But I think to best experience it, one needs  a biologist-botanist someone who can explain more of what we saw.  No snakes, thank heavens, but we were always  on the watch.  The closest was a 6 inch  bright red centipede.  The butterflies  almost made me want to get out my early childhood net. </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">It was interesting as we ate together and talked about our  return to the US that the director, Darwin and a couple of the other EC on the  adventure asked us to take them along in our suitcases.  Getting into the US is very difficult for  Latin Americans currently.....</p>

	<hr />
	<p><strong>Year 2006: Suggestions and Thoughts...</strong></p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Here are our suggestions/thoughts.  I hope that they are helpful for the  continued evolution of the clinic.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">We both feel that a medical director, a physician, for the  clinic is becoming essential.  How this  position would be filled can vary and it is probably the most difficult of our  suggestions.  We feel that the clinic is  being pulled in many directions i.e. the different kinds of surgeons/surgeries  wanting to come with the different requirements for nursing care, medications,  and equipment need to be managed.  The  clinic can not be all things to all people.    Hard decisions about what will be available at the clinic need to be  made based on medical needs, facilities and steady staff.  In order to maintain quality and not over  reach what is possible there needs to be an agreed upon vision .  This vision will then dictate what donations  are solicited/received in the areas of medications/equipment etc. <br />
	</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">If surgeons are at the clinic doing surgeries which require  nursing involvement in monitoring the recovery, they - they surgeons - need to  bring nurses along with their team.  I do  not feel that it is appropriate for Amanda to be given this responsibility  along with the other ones she carries.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">I would suggest that a basic medical orientation form be  developed for the volunteer doctors around issues seen at the clinic for which  they might need increased understanding. Ideas include information about the  treatment of parasites, amoebas, worms etc.   Medications that are available, dosages, - basically treatment protocols  would be helpful.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Information about the complaint of mareo - dizziness which  can be the result of dehydration or sustained sun exposure and the fact that  this can be helped by increased water consumption in the fields etc.  Volunteer doctors more than likely are not  familiar with the kind of work and the conditions for that work experienced by  the patients who come to the clinic.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Include information about how to refer patients to medical  centers in Loja/Cuenca.  i.e. forms  needed/phone calls/ what is the process so that the volunteers know how to get  this done when necessary.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Also include information for the volunteers about when  Germania is available to fit glasses and how to access her when a patient comes  in after Germania has called to see if she has anyone needing her  attention.  The volunteers need to know  the hours and any dental technician working by the eye glasses place also needs  to know how to direct patients whose first stop is that spot - because the see  the sign &quot;lentes&quot;.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Other medical issues which are present/frequent in the area  .</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">This information could be developed and put in printed form  to be handed to the new volunteers.  <br />
	</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The patient health education forms that Ken was working on  need to be put to use.  They need to be  printed and copies need to be made available in each exam room for the doctors  to hand to the patients they see who could benefit from that information.  During the month we were there, these were  not handed out and much good can be achieved by using this way of  education.  While not all patients can  read, the doctor could ask if they would like some printed material which would  be helpful, and those who can not read can say 'no&quot;.<br />
	</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">The physician exam rooms need to be set up with standard  supplies and maintained so that those supplies are always available.  This would decrease the time on Amanda's part  to track down supplies which are needed and allow the Dr. to be more efficient  with less frustration.  Ideas to include  are:</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">a.  Otoscopes and  ophthalmoscopes - rechargeable ones - not battery operated<br />
		b.  Gloves - sterile  and non-sterile<br />
		c.  Sterile knife blades<br />
		d.  Clear slides for paps and wet  mounts.  The current slides are cloudy  and need to be discarded.  <br />
		And new clear  slides ordered.  It is not possible to do  accurate paps with the current slides.<br />
		e.  Sterile Q tips<br />
		f.  Tongue blades<br />
		g.  Prescription pads<br />
		h.  Pens<br />
		i.  English/Spanish  dictionary<br />
		j.  Dressing  supplies   4x4 or 2x2<br />
		k.  Tape<br />
		l.  Sterile syringes<br />
		m.  Xylocaine<br />
		There may be other supplies - I'd suggest asking Ken for  input.<br />
		<br />
		Orient any volunteer nurses to the location of these basic  supplies  - they can be the ones to  restock the exam room - as well as where other emergency/basic supplies are  available.  This would also cut down on  the work Amanda currently does.<br />
		<br />
		Consider purchasing sleeping mats such as therma rest pads  for the Jornadas to be used in instances when the medical team is not sleeping  at hotels.<br />
		<br />
		I noticed while there that some of the patient records have  understandably gotten out of alphabetical order.  This is something that a volunteer could  review (a little training/explanation) and put in order.  Would save time for Rita/Amanada in finding  previous patient records.<br />
		<br />
		The volunteers need to know how to handle requests for food  from Loja.  Specifically they need to  know what they can request to be paid for by the mission and what they need to  pay for themselves. <br />
		<br />
		<em>This idea needs to be highlighted</em>.    A  basic formulary (listing of medications) needs to be developed.  This would include the medications that are  used regularly in the clinic.  Parasite  meds, diabetes meds, cheap generic blood pressure meds such as HCTZ, Atenolol  or other basic beta blockers (Ken could certainly provide input in developing  this) etc. which are always available.   These may need to be purchased, but would then be always available to  patients and the Drs.  Now patients are  started on meds for High blood pressure which have been donated, and when they  come back for a refill that med may not be available and they then have to be  switched to a different drug which does not work well for stable control.  </p>
	<p class="erfahrung">There are also many drugs which are currently  not   used, take up space in the pharmacy and out date.  With the development of a clear vision for  the kinds of medical care the clinic will provide and taking into account the  kinds of problems which the Drs. see on a regular basis, decisions could be  made which would identify the necessary meds as well as those which are not  needed.  This could then help target the  donations as there are some meds which simply aren't needed in Guadalupe but  which come and take up shelf space.<br />
		<br />
		If the clinic is ever asked about what donations are needed,  I'd suggest a request for toothbrushes which could be given out to the  children.<br />
		<br />
		What about free dental care for the children including some  basic education about dental care?<br />
		<br />
		Guess this is all for now.   We really saw much progress in the clinic over the two years between our  visits.  Evidence of much hard work.  Our greatest concern is that there needs to  be a vision about what the clinic can do well and regularly and those needs  need to be targeted.  There is a danger  in attempting to provide all services to everyone.</p>
	<p class="erfahrung">Take care.  Hasta  luego!</p>
