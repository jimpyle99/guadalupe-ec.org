		<h4 class="erfahrung"> <strong><a name="Welcome" id="Welcome"></a>Welcome to the Orientation Guide for our Clinic.&nbsp; </strong></h4>
		<p class="erfahrung">This information is based on my personal experiences accumulated through my year of working here in Guadalupe.&nbsp; The Clinic has been an amazing place to work, where the patients are truly appreciative of your work and time, and come to call you &ldquo;Doctors Who Cure.&rdquo;&nbsp; They leave their homes in the early morning hours to get in line before our doors open, and wait for hours for their turn.&nbsp; It has been a privilege and responsibility to have this kind of trust from the people here. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> However, working in the Clinic has also been very challenging.&nbsp; The cultural differences, different           concepts of medicine, lack of continuity of care, lack of adequate           auxiliary staff, oftentimes very basic medicines and equipment, and           language barrier can make treatment of the patients in this region very           difficult.&nbsp; In addition, coping with the slow rate at which change           occurs, in trying to improve the standard of care of the clinic, can be           frustrating at times.&nbsp; As the patients come to trust you more and more           and see that your type of medicine works, they will follow up, and then           the rewards are fulfilling in working here! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patients and their           appreciation of what you do make this job worthwhile. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> I hope that this guide is           helpful to you as you begin your own experiences working here in this           very special place.&nbsp; I have been as honest and complete as I know how to           be, with the bad and the good.&nbsp; Overall, in my time here, there has been           a wealth of improvement in our level of care, and the services that we           have been able to provide.&nbsp; Change does occur, if little by little (poco           a poco….)&nbsp; If you should have any questions, or anything warrants           clarification, please drop a line to <a href="mailto:superbeena@hotmail.com">superbeena@hotmail.com</a><a href="mailto:beena@guadalupe-ec.org"></a></p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> And if you want the real low           down and dirty, definitely drop a line, and we can talk before you           arrive.&nbsp; Forgive my detail oriented musings….  </p>
		<div class="tothetopdivtag"><a href="#Orientationguide">To the top</a></div>
	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Patients" id="Patients"></a>The Patients </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The patients range in age from           newborn to old age.&nbsp; Depending on the experiences and abilities of the           doctors in the Clinic, you may be able to see the patients within your           specialty.&nbsp; For example, I am a pediatrician; however, during most of my           tenure here, I have been the only doctor, and thus have been seeing all           the patients, regardless of age.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The patients range from very           poor to the middle class, from living in the countryside as farmers to           living in the city.&nbsp; Most of the patients work in agriculture, using           their machetes, planting, harvesting.&nbsp; Patients may also have other           jobs, including secretaries, teachers, bus drivers, construction           workers, miners.&nbsp; They have a range of economic wealth, some being           unable to afford even the simplest treatments, to others, who travel           from the bigger cities like Loja and will pay for many tests, consults           and medicines.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> There are three main cultural           groups:&nbsp; the Saraguro, the mestizo, and the Shuar.&nbsp; They tend to           intermarry within their own indigenous groups, thus are relatively           culturally homogenous.&nbsp; The Saraguro men usually have long braided hair,           with black short pants, and easy to distinguish black felt hats.&nbsp; The           women wear many layers of skirts, including a top pleated skirt, the           anako, paired with a colorful blouse, and elaborate beaded jewelry.&nbsp; The           Shuar have a typical facial appearance with high cheekbones.&nbsp; Both           groups use traditional medicine, things such as &ldquo;uña del gato&rdquo;, or           &ldquo;sangre de dragon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;horchattas&rdquo; or &ldquo;aguas del monte&rdquo; to cure illness           before seeking modern medicine.  </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> There are some important           cultural distinctions that can make treating these patients more           difficult.&nbsp; First of all, the reliance upon traditional medicines and           natural remedies cannot be discounted.&nbsp; As a general rule, patients try           natural remedies before entering your consultorio.&nbsp; Secondly, their           representation of illness is often more dramatic and the symptoms are           different than what you may be used to.&nbsp; Use all of your physical exam           skills to determine if the symptoms are truly worrisome.&nbsp; For example, I           had a Shuar woman writhing with a complaint of all over body pain, with           a pulse of 60.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rely on your clinical judgment in these cases, as           often, their history and exam do not mesh well.&nbsp; The Shuar also have a           reputation of putting blame on those that help them, looking for a           reason that an illness was caused (there is much prejudice against them           for this very reason).&nbsp; I can give many experiences in which the Shuar           have been extremely challenging patients for their reliance on           traditional medicine, their lack of understanding of modern medicine,           their refusal to go to the hospital in case of emergency. <span class="erfahrung">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

		<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Knowledge" id="Knowledge"></a>Patient Knowledge </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The patients&rsquo; lack of           understanding regarding their own health problems can be frustrating.&nbsp;           They may have chronic illnesses, but have no understanding of what those           are, and be unable to describe the condition.&nbsp; In addition, they may           have had surgeries, and be unable to tell you exactly why.&nbsp; They may           have been treated with medicine, and be unable to tell you what           medicine, and why they were taking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> This is one of the greatest           frustrations of working in the Clinic.&nbsp; Doing a Past Medical History,           Past Surgical History and Current Medication List can make you grit your           teeth and want to scream.&nbsp; I have had several patients tell me that they           had &ldquo;tumors&rdquo; but were unable to tell me in which organ, and why the           tumor was removed, or if it was cancerous!&nbsp; Do not even think about           asking for pathology reports….I even had one woman tell me that she kept           her uterus in formaldehyde at home, and told me that she could bring the           jar for me to examine. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Part of the problem, in my           opinion, comes from a lack of education on the part of the patients, a           misunderstanding of basic concepts of health, and a lack of patient           education on the part of other doctors who have treated the patient and           not given clear explanations for the illness nor the medications. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Thus, I have tried to do a lot           of education regarding taking responsibility for one&rsquo;s own health care,           including bringing prior records, boxes or prescriptions of the           medicine, or lab results, in addition to demanding from other doctors           simple explanations for the illnesses that they have.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of           the biggest differences in health education that you can make during           your time here. </p>

		<p class="erfahrung"> Right now, the order in which           you see patients is in the order in which they arrive, in fact, the           patients will fight each other to cut in the line in order to be first,           etc.&nbsp; It is hard to place judgments on the order to see the patients           when certain have traveled extremely far to arrive to see you.&nbsp; There is           no time for you to do the triage, nor has there been enough staff with           the experience to triage well.&nbsp; Thus, we tend to attend to the patients           in the order in which they arrive. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Occasionally, the nurses will           alert you to a particularly sick patient that needs attention earlier.&nbsp;           Many times, the patients will make themselves out to be sicker than they           really are in order to be attended to earlier.&nbsp; Thus, I let the nurses           screen these patients so that I may be seeing the patients in the order           in which they were assigned.&nbsp; This is our rough system of triage, which           is not always the greatest to pick up sick patients.&nbsp; In addition,           taking a patient out of order makes the other patients, who may have           traveled further or waited longer, very angry. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Oftentimes, the patients with           obvious emergencies, such as a deformed arm, a bleeding cut,&nbsp; are           attended to immediately, but others, with not so obvious sicknesses, are           left waiting.&nbsp; Thus, there are holes in this form of triage.&nbsp; A cyanotic           infant was not recognized.&nbsp; Or I have been asked to see a child just           because he was crying, without vital signs being taken.&nbsp; There have been           several times when asthmatics have sat in the hall for hours, waiting,           when they could have been quickly evaluated, and steroids and albuterol           nebulizers begun.&nbsp; In addition, I have had children sit the hallway           without anti-pyretics to bring down fever.&nbsp; Little by little, we are           improving on attending to the patients in a more orderly fashion. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Medicines" id="Medicines"></a>Medicines </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The Clinic has a very extensive           pharmacy, with donated medicines from the United States and Austria.&nbsp;           There are antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antidiabetic           medications, antihypertensive, and lipid lowering, among others.&nbsp; In           addition, we are able to buy medications from drug representatives here           in Ecuador (yes, they still do exist here, and are just as squirrelly as           in the U.S.!) when we are running low on something.&nbsp;           However, we rely heavily on donated medications.&nbsp;           Most of the medications that we can buy here, in my experience, do not           have as good an effect, as strong an effect, or any effect at all.&nbsp;           (There is even one snake oils salesman that sells medicines out of his           pick up truck… unfortunately, we buy a variety of concoctions from him,           that probably do not do much for the people other than take their           money!) </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Challenges that I have faced           regarding the prescribing of medicines includes: </p>
		<ol>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Incorrect use of medicine: &nbsp;In any store or local pharmacy, a           patient can walk in and buy medicine without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.&nbsp; I           have seen women walk into a pharmacy and purchase a combination pill           with Fluphenazine and Nortriptyline for an infant&rsquo;s colic!&nbsp; (Regulations           are starting to pop up to control this more and more, but as of yet,           there has not been much control over this unofficial use of           medication.)&nbsp; Thus a patient will often self-treat with medication or           natural remedies before arriving to the Clinic.&nbsp; Most commonly, people           will buy one Ampicillin (Ampibex) tablet for a cold or skin infection,           or a Naprosyn (Apronax) for pain or infection.&nbsp;<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]>&nbsp;

				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                     Desire for Injections:&nbsp; Many patients desire injections.&nbsp; There           is a conception that injections work faster and stronger than other           medicines, even though they are more expensive.&nbsp; In addition, patients           think that one injection will cure an illness.&nbsp; For example, many use           one injection of Gentamicin to cure a common cold.&nbsp; Many want &ldquo;sueros,&rdquo;           or IV injections of vitamins or other medicines to cure illness, and           some even know how to put in their own IVs at home to give intravenous           medications.&nbsp; Another example is IM Diclofenac for musculoskeletal           pain.&nbsp; The most dangerous example are the patients who desire IV CALCIUM           for their bone pains!&nbsp; Patients do occasionally share needles with           injections.&nbsp; The perception exists that a quick shot of medicine is all           they need to cure most illness.&nbsp; In my time here, I have rarely given           injections as to not feed into this dependence on injections and instead           have tried to educate on the risks of injections, such as higher cost,           risk of infection, etc.&nbsp; If the patient can swallow, I do not give           injections.&nbsp; I also try to educate the patients WHY injections are not           needed, when the patient is capable of buying a tablet, that he can           swallow, that costs less, and avoids risks on injections.		<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]>&nbsp;<br />

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Misunderstanding of Chronic Treatments:&nbsp; Because of this desire           for a &ldquo;quick fix,&rdquo; an injection that will quickly cure their illness,           the patients need to be more educated regarding chronic illness, for           example, high blood pressure and diabetes, illnesses that are monitored           on a chronic basis and not treatable with a quick ten day course of           medicine.&nbsp; Patients need to understand clearly that they have a chronic           illness, and when you want to see them back.		<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]>&nbsp;

				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">Vitamins&nbsp;           (THIS ONE IS THE BIGGIE):&nbsp; The patients are very concerned regarding           vitamin deficiencies, although I have rarely seen a clearcut case of           vitamin deficiency.&nbsp; Instead of dispensing           a lot of vitamins, which are expensive, I have tried to do more           education of the balanced diet, and have           only given vitamins to pregnant women, children with poor growth, or           calcium to menopausal women.&nbsp; I have tried to avoid reinforcing this           worry about vitamin deficiencies by giving vitamins, except in clearcut           cases where I have seen actually vitamin deficiencies exist.&nbsp; Another           problem is that the vitamins that we do carry in the pharmacy do not           come in combinations that are useful for treating actual vitamin           deficiencies.&nbsp; For example, our vitamins for pregnant women do not have           an adequate amount of folate.&nbsp; The vitamins that we buy for children           focus on different types of Vitamin B, rather than calcium or iron.&nbsp; I           have not been able to find a combination vitamin that has the amounts           needed of recommended vitamins. Giving           vitamins, without also a discussion of a balanced diet, in my opinion,           is not providing quality care.&nbsp; (It takes           more time to explain a balanced diet, but the people have little           understanding of this!!&nbsp; Only giving vitamins reinforces the false           belief that they have that many conditions can be cured with vitamins.)&nbsp;           Many local doctors use Vitamin B shots (in the forms of Rojamin,           Neurogime, Neurobion, Beco 5) to cure a variety of illness to           miscarriage, musculoskeletal pain, any medical complaint.&nbsp;           Unfortunately, our Clinic does carry the Vitamin B shots, which does           send a mixed message to patients, even though I have NEVER prescribed           these during my time here.&nbsp; It would be a goal to STOP CARRYING VITAMIN           B PRODUCTS IN OUR PHARMACY.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please continue to argue against Vitamin B           in the pharmacy.&nbsp; We have had discussions regarding selling of Vitamin           B, and currently, because our philosophy is to have a pharmacy that           serves the other doctors in the region, and they prescribe Vitamin B, we           continue to carry the Vitamin B.&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Stopping Treatments Early:&nbsp; Because of their desire for a quick           fix, the patients are unsatisfied if the medicines do not work right           away.&nbsp; They are impatient to take a full course of medicine for 7 to 10           days, and will often take the treatment for a day or so before visiting           another doctor, who will most likely change your treatment.&nbsp; For this           reason, I try to reinforce the duration of treatment, and why it is           important to complete the treatment, and if the treatment does not work           well, make sure you tell them to come back.&nbsp; If they know that you want           to see them again, they will return instead of going to someone else.&nbsp;           Also, I try to give a clear idea of how many days they will need to get           better, and return precautions, symptoms or scenarios in which I will           worry that the treatment is not working well.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; &ldquo;Your child           has a cold.&nbsp; His body will fight this over the course of 5-7 days.&nbsp; If           he has fever that lasts more than 3 days, vomiting with blood, pus           draining from his ear, is not drinking enough to produce one urine every           eight hours, or other worries, please come back right away.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                     The patients always want some sort of medicine:&nbsp; This can be a           challenge, because the patients always feel that they must leave with           SOMETHING.&nbsp; So, for example, there are times when I do give medicine, if           just to keep them from going to another doctor who may give them           something completely useless, such as Vitamin B shots.&nbsp; If my giving a           child with a cold a cough syrup prevents them from going to another           doctor for a shot of penicillin, I err on the side of the cough syrup.&nbsp;           The PLACEBO EFFECT is huge, otherwise, I doubt there would be much use           for vitamin shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<![endif]>
				<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    The patients like polypharmacy:&nbsp; Sometimes it is unavoidable….           You have to give one person four or five medicines, but I try to stick           to a fewer number of medicines to avoid confusion.&nbsp; If the patient comes           in with a complaint for every organ system (and there are MANY of these           patients!), I tell them clearly that I cannot address every problem           today, and we will start with the most bothersome, so that they will           take a few medicines correctly, instead of being confused with many           medicines, that will then do nothing.
				&nbsp;
				<![endif]>
				<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">The patients share medicines:&nbsp;&nbsp; If one person uses a medicine           that helps them, they will share it with their neighbor or husband           whether or not they have discussed it with a doctor first.&nbsp; Just beware           that this occurs.
				<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">The patients do not buy the course of medicine as you           prescribed.&nbsp; DO NOT ASSUME THAT PATIENTS BOUGHT EVERYTHING THAT YOU           PRESCRIBED.&nbsp; For the most part, Rita, the woman who works in the           pharmacy, knows the difference between antibiotics and other medicines,           and she will not sell a partial treatment for antibiotics. &nbsp;I have also           asked for some better communication when the patients cannot buy the           medicine on the prescription exactly as written, so that I can indicate           to her which medicines are more important to sell.&nbsp; For example, an           asthmatic patient was buying Singulair instead of her steroid inhaler.&nbsp;           Do not assume that the patients bought everything that you prescribed.  </li>
			</ol>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Because the supply of certain           medicines may be limited, for example, in my time here, we have been           lacking beta agonist inhalers, I have tried to save the medicine for the           sicker patients that I have with asthma.&nbsp; However, other doctors receive           the list of our medications, and use our pharmacy as the source of their           prescriptions, and often they do not use the medication correctly.&nbsp; This           can be extremely frustrating, as oftentimes, they are overtreating a           patient, or using a medicine for a condition for which it does not           serve…. This has often occurred with inhalers, antibiotics (specifically           flouroquinolones and Augmentin), even blood pressure, cholesterol or           diabetes medicines.&nbsp; Even if you have a plan for how to allocate the           medicine, you are not the only one using it.&nbsp; Again, I could discuss the           use of injections to cure everything.&nbsp; They may give one dose of           Ampicillin (Ampibex) to cure skin infections or the common cold.&nbsp; I           could discuss vitamin shots.&nbsp; I could discuss the misuse of           antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> This can be frustrating, when           the supply of medicine is limited, and it is not being used correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;           Right now the philosophy of the pharmacy is that it is to serve other           doctors of the region as well, even though the ways in which they           prescribe medicine are different than ours (use of antibiotics for           colds, vitamin shots, etc.).&nbsp; Thus, right now, there are NO RULES           controlling the sale of medicine by their prescriptions, so be aware           that you may not have used the Augmentin supply, but little by little,           it was being prescribed by someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Try to work with the dentists in           the Clinic as well, so that they are not using your valuable medicine           supply other than how you would want to use it!&nbsp; For example, some of           the dentists were using Augmentin as first line for dental abscesses,           when cheaper and just as effective medicines are available.&nbsp; Given           Augmentin&rsquo;s broad usage for other things, it would be nice to save it           for more serious infections! </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Antibiotic resistance is a bit           of a problem, but I have not seen any studies on this here.&nbsp; I still           start with the common first line drugs (Amoxicillin for ear infections,           Bactrim, Amoxicillin or Cephalexin for UTI in kids or Bactrim or           Ciprofloxacin for UTI in adults, for example)&nbsp; and give the patient           guidelines for returning. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Prescriptions" id="Prescriptions"></a>Writing Prescriptions </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> When you have decided what           medicines you will use, you will write these down in a prescription.&nbsp;           The patients need everything written down very clearly, and will           probably ask you for specific times and with what type of tea (&ldquo;Aguita&rdquo;           or &ldquo;Horchatta&rdquo;) that they can take the medicine.&nbsp; I write EVERY DETAIL           as clearly as I can on the prescription, including the indication for           the medicine.&nbsp; Many patients are elderly, cannot see, cannot read, and           are forgetful.&nbsp; They will hopefully have someone to help them read your           prescription later, and if you have written everything down completely,           it will be a big help to this third party who did not hear your           explanation.</p>
		<p> For example: </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Enalapril 5 mg #30 </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Toma una tableta antes del           desayuno diario&nbsp; (presión) </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Aspirina 100 mg #30</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Toma una tableta antes del           desayuno diario (circulación) </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Instead of putting down specific           times, I tended to say &ldquo;before breakfast&rdquo; for one time per day medicines           or &ldquo;before breakfast and dinner&rdquo; for twice a day medicines, just to make           things easier.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> For patients with chronic           illness that I would like to see again, I tend to do things on a month           by month basis.&nbsp; There is enough time for the medicine to take an           effect, and the patient is not required to buy too much of the medicine           all at once, as the economic limitations are important to remember.  </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Oftentimes, patients will ask           you to write for medicines for patients that you have not seen.&nbsp; I have           made it my policy to only write prescriptions for patients that I have           actually seen, except for over the counter medicines.&nbsp; The pharmacy will           often sell parasite treatments without a prescription. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> In addition, oftentimes, the           nurses will ask me to review the prescription of another doctor to           substitute another medicine or change a prescription.&nbsp; The policy of the           Clinic has been to serve the other doctors, carrying medicines that           normally we would not use, such as Vitamin B shots, and other           medicines.&nbsp; In my opinion, then, changing a prescription without the           knowledge of that doctor is incorrect.&nbsp; Thus, when asked to change a           prescription, I ask the nurses to call the doctor who prescribed the           medicine, and communicate the problem with the prescription.&nbsp; I would           not want someone to change my prescription without my knowledge, and I           am trying to give that same courtesy.&nbsp; Otherwise, I have offered to see           the patient, but that necessitates him buying another consulta.&nbsp; I set           this policy because while I do not agree with certain treatments of the           other doctors such as Vitamin B, etc., and when I have argued that the           pharmacy should not carry these medicines, I was told that our pharmacy           is here to serve the other doctors of the region as well.&nbsp; If we really           want the pharmacy to serve the doctors of the region, the staff in the           pharmacy has to communicate with those doctors directly if they want to           change the prescription.&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="tothetopdivtag"><a href="#Orientationguide">To the top</a></div>
	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Schedule" id="Schedule"></a>The Clinic Schedule </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The Clinic opens at 8 AM and           closes at 5 PM, on Mondays through Fridays.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunch at the Convent           starts at noon, and it is best to plan your day accordingly to be down           at lunch as punctually as possible, although it is understood that you           may be late on occasion, when dealing with a tough patient, etc.&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="tothetopdivtag"><a href="#Orientationguide">To the top</a></div>
	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Dress" id="Dress"></a>Dress Code </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Scrubs are the preferable dress           for the doctors in the Clinic.&nbsp; There is a small supply of scrubs that           you can borrow during your time here, or you may want to bring your own           that fit, and then leave them upon your departure to increase our           supply! </p>
		<div class="tothetopdivtag"><a href="#Orientationguide">To the top</a></div>
	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Numbers" id="Numbers"></a>Patient Numbers </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> A lot of things affect the           number of patients who arrive each day.&nbsp; In general, Mondays and Fridays           tend to be busier than most other days.&nbsp; If, for some reason, the buses           are not running (for example, in my time, landslides and teachers&rsquo;           strikes have kept the buses from running at times), the numbers are           low.&nbsp; In addition, around holidays, fewer patients arrive.&nbsp; During times           where there are dentists or eye doctors, expect more patients to           arrive.&nbsp; With the recent eye doctor and ENT visitors, we have had almost           200 patients waiting for us each morning.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> It is up to YOU to decide the           number of patients that you are capable of seeing.&nbsp; To give a reference,           I see 25 to 30 patients as a limit.&nbsp; The most important thing is to do a           complete consult, making sure that you understand what the patient wants           from you, and making sure that the patient understands your advice.&nbsp;           When I first arrived, I was seeing over 30 patients a day, making           quickie diagnoses, and unable to spend quality time with the patients,           and I HATED IT because I was not enjoying the job, and was working late           every day.&nbsp; The patients appreciate the time that you spend, as some           other doctors do not even take the time to examine the patients!&nbsp;&nbsp; Also           make sure that you know your own limits, because a doctor who is burned           out is not much help to anyone. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> When we have large patient           numbers, for example, almost 200, we allow the patients to buy ONE           ficha, for whichever specialist they most need. &nbsp;If fichas are available           after everyone has had a chance to buy one, we may allow them to buy a           second.&nbsp; In this way, everyone can have a chance to be seen. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Protecting" id="Protecting"></a>Protecting Yourself </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Working in the Clinic is           rewarding, but it can be tiring.&nbsp; Seeing a large number of patients, and           changing your mindset to think of each individual&rsquo;s problem and           diagnosis can be mentally exhausting.&nbsp; Know your limits, and be prepared           to defend them.&nbsp; The people will take advantage of all that you give           them, and still ask for more, so know when you need to say NO. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Sometimes you may feel as though           you are on call all the time, as the patients know where to find you, in           the Residence right behind the Clinic.&nbsp; Most patients know to come           Monday through Friday, during Clinic hours.&nbsp; But at all hours of the           night and weekend, you may receive a knock on the door, or your window,           asking for a consult, or to open the Clinic to buy medicine.&nbsp; It is at           your discretion to see patients at the other times.&nbsp; If you do not feel           that it is an emergency, be firm in your decision to make the person           wait until the Clinic is open.&nbsp; If you open the Clinic to one person,           then everyone expects the same!&nbsp; Be careful of getting yourself in this           practice.&nbsp; Padre Jorge and Amanda have been supportive of my setting           limits.&nbsp; Protect your free time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Occasionally, we have received           requests to visit patients in their homes.&nbsp; In special cases, I have           agreed to do this.&nbsp; We charge $1 for the ficha, and the patient&rsquo;s family           can come to the Clinic to buy the medicine. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> People tend to bother Amanda           (who has the key to the Clinic), the nurse, more than the doctors, in           order to persuade her to open the Clinic to buy medicine.&nbsp; The patients           may go to the doctors in the Subcentro for the consulta and come with a           prescription in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Her practice has been to open           the Clinic if the patient has a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Things that we have done to           protect the doctors a bit more are to say NO when the patient does not           have an emergency, to teach the people that we do NOT open the clinic at           their discretion.&nbsp; Also, Amanda opens the pharmacy for half an hour           after Sunday Mass to sell medicine.&nbsp; The patients thus have ample           opportunity to plan to buy their medicine when the Clinic is open. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Perception" id="Perception"></a>Perception of Foreign Doctors </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Some people will prefer your           care to that of an Ecuadorian doctor for the sheer fact that you are a           foreigner.&nbsp; Other patients will think that because you do not use           vitamin shots or natural medicine, you cannot help them.&nbsp; Because of the           doctor shopping that often occurs, you have one chance to make a           difference to a patient.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really communicate well your           treatments despite the language barrier, they will come back.&nbsp; If you           give them the opportunity to know that you want them to follow up to           provide continuity of care, they will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, you have medicine on your           side (that is why we are called the &ldquo;doctors that cure&rdquo;)!&nbsp; Give them a           time frame for when they will get better, and when to come back if they           are not.&nbsp;</p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Other" id="Other"></a>Other Doctors </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Across the Hanging Bridge that           leads from the Mission to the town of Guadalupe, there is a Subcentro of           health, staffed by an Ecuadorian doctor (Dr. Alan) and dentist (Dr.           Alvaro) and several nurses.&nbsp; The nurses here function independently,           doing consultas and prescribing medicine.&nbsp; During my time here, there           have been mostly friendly relations between the staff at the Subcentro           and our Clinic.&nbsp; Their staff uses the medicines from our pharmacy, which           offers cheaper prices, to prescribe for their patients.&nbsp; Our pharmacy           stocks medicines that they specifically request, although the doctors           here in the Clinic do not use, such as a variety of Vitamin shots.&nbsp; The           patients pay $0.50 for the ficha (ticket) there.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The people of the town of           Guadalupe itself tend to go to the Subcentro first for health care,           because of the longstanding relationship of the local doctor, Dr. Alan,           with the people.&nbsp; However, as I have described earlier, the patients           tend to be distrustful of doctors and impatient if treatments do not           work right away.&nbsp; Thus, they tend to doctor shop between the Subcentro,           our Clinic, in addition to other clinics in Zamora or Loja.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> I have tried to balance giving           good health care, and not badmouthing the local doctors, which sometimes           can be challenging.&nbsp; Dr. Alan does a lot of work on weekends and at           night, when patients would otherwise be banging on my door.&nbsp; I try to           reinforce the people&rsquo;s faith in him, even if I do not always agree with           the treatment.&nbsp; Overall, he cares about the people here and is a good           doctor. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> However, I would be dishonest to           say that overall, the health care here in Ecuador is good.&nbsp; Patients are           distrustful of doctors and for good reason.&nbsp; Many own their own           pharmacies, and thus may prescribe three forms of Vitamin B shots under           different names, to treat a variety of illness.&nbsp; I have had patients who           were frankly mismanaged for a variety of things, from congestive heart           failure (having IV fluids given) to breast cysts (removed and noted to           be benign, with the 30 year old patient put on Tamoxifen and being put           into menopause) to numerous other cases.&nbsp; The cases will shock you!&nbsp;</p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Lab" id="Lab"></a>Lab Tests </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The patients love lab tests!&nbsp;&nbsp;           There seems to be no discernment in ordering tests to find out specific           information; there is just a big random ordering of whatever tests for           whatever reasons, without taking the time to think things through.&nbsp;           Patients love to screen themselves for different diseases, and can go to           a privately owned lab, where the lab owner is only too happy to mark up           a lab sheet charging the patient for a CBC, lipid panel, BUN, Cr, SGOT,           SGPT, Creactive protein, ASTO, Rhematoid factor.&nbsp; The patient will then           bring these tests to you, having made their own diagnosis! </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The lab tests are misused in a           variety of ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, many patients obtain lab tests without           talking to a doctor first to see what lab tests are needed.&nbsp; Secondly,           the labs may not be doing the tests in the correct manner.&nbsp; For example,           the laboratories are not doing clean catch urines, so be wary of           contaminated urine specimens, for which the patients are actually           treated with antibiotics for infection.&nbsp; Thirdly, the labs are ordering           tests without doing consultas, and thinking through specifically what           lab tests the patient needs and why.&nbsp; Fourthly, I have been unsure at           times how much to rely on the validity of some of the test results.&nbsp;           Patients will usually come to the Clinic &ldquo;en ayunas&rdquo; or fasting, in           preparation to order many lab tests.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The labs here use ASTO (ASO),           PCR (C reactive protein) and Rhematoid factor to make the diagnosis of           acute rheumatic fever, or rheumatism, often without a doctors&rsquo; consult           first.&nbsp; The patients are told that they need 6 months of penicillin           shots, if they have an elevated ASTO or Rheumatoid factor. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> We have the capability to do           some basic lab tests, including </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Blood Glucose $1</li>
			<li> Urine Pregnancy Test $2</li>
			<li> Complete Urinalysis $1</li>
			<li> Urinalysis with Leukocytes and           Nitrites $0.50</li>
			<li> ECG $0.50</li>
			<li> CBC $4</li>
			<li> Cholesterol/Glucose $4</li>
			<li> Papanicolau and wet prep $2</li>
			<li> Stool prep (Free)</li>
			<li> Hemoccult (Free) </li>
			</ul>
		<p class="erfahrung"> We have recently received a           machine with the capability of performing a variety of lab tests,           including HbA1C, SGPT, cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, sodium,           potassium, and others.&nbsp; As of now, we have not used the machine           secondary to the need for micropipettes to measure out a very small           quantity of blood and reagent to perform the test.&nbsp; When we are able to           obtain these micropipettes, it will also be important to figure out how           much reagent to mix up, how long the reagent will last, and whether or           not the test will in the long run be cheaper to do in another           laboratory.&nbsp; (If we are to make money on the test, this will be           important, because it involves having to continually buy reagent, etc.)&nbsp;           This will be up to the doctors who follow me to decide.&nbsp; My other           concern is that for fear of letting reagents expire, tests will be           unnecessarily ordered, and at the expense of the patients who cannot           afford them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Because of the wide range of           economic abilities of the patients, not everyone can afford a lot of lab           tests.&nbsp; Talk with your patient first if you want to order exams.&nbsp; In my           experience, ordering a lot of exams will sometimes turn them off, and           then you will have lost them as a patient.&nbsp; They will nod their head in           agreement, but will not come back.&nbsp; Or they may come back, and hang           their head and say that they could not afford all of the tests.&nbsp; This is           a big difference from my experience in the US, where I am used to           ordering lots of lab tests to confirm a diagnosis.&nbsp; That is NOT feasible           here.&nbsp; I really try to ask myself what knowing a certain lab result will           change about my management, because each lab test is a bit of the           patients&rsquo; precious money that we are spending.&nbsp; Will I treat if the           result is abnormal?&nbsp; Just ordering tests TO KNOW does not help the           patients, and they will not come back.&nbsp; Oftentimes, I may try a           treatment, and ask the patient to follow-up, with the intention of           ordering a lab test at that time, if things are not improving.&nbsp; I try to           make the doctor-patient relationship a collaboration, so that the           patients know to return and talk if things are not getting better.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> It is also important to have a           bit of suspicion regarding the validity of the tests.&nbsp; I have had           patients bring results of sodium of 93.&nbsp; When I have ordered Xrays, they           are done from an incorrect angle, and like I mentioned above, often,           urine exams are not midstream clean catch specimens. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Consultorio" id="Consultorio"></a>Your Consultorio and Resources </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> There are two general medical           examining rooms in the Clinic, two rooms for the dentists, an operating           room, a nurses&rsquo; station, a room for storage, a room for sterilization,           and a room with a bed and the crash cart.&nbsp; There is a laboratory where           the nurses do the blood and urine testing, and also a microscope to view           wet preps and stool preps.&nbsp; The main medical examining room has two           examining tables, both with stirrups to do pelvic exams.&nbsp; In addition,           there is an adult regular blood pressure cuff, and an           ophthalmoscope/otoscope unit attached the wall.&nbsp; A private bathroom is           attached.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> There is also a computer in the           main consultorio, with the ability to tell you the list of medications           from the pharmacy, and how much of each medication is available.&nbsp; There           is also the ability to find out what medicines a person has bought in           the past.&nbsp; The computer is very helpful to look up costs of medications,           and how many tablets of each medication that we have, to help you in           individualizing your treatment, plus knowing what resources are           available.&nbsp;&nbsp; The medication and patient list, are for the most part, up           to date, but room for improvement still exists to make the computer work           better for us by entering medications under each individual patient&rsquo;s           name, rather than medications for a whole family under one name.&nbsp;           Sometimes the medicines are not correctly recorded under anyone&rsquo;s name,           so this system is not always completely reliable. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> We are currently increasing the           medical library in the Clinic, and the main consultorio has a bookshelf           with many resources that we have received from other doctors,           including:&nbsp;</p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Finances" id="Finances"></a>Patient Finances </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The patients come from a variety           of economic backgrounds.&nbsp; Our Clinic has the cheapest medical care and           medicine available to the people in the region.&nbsp; Still, there are some           patients who may have a hard time affording what we offer. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Every patient must come with $1           for the initial ficha, the number in the line to see you.&nbsp; We do not           change or lower this price for anyone.&nbsp; We practice the philosophy that           everyone must contribute something to keep the clinic going, for their           dignity, and plus in order to value the service that we provide.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> I cannot stress enough the           importance of communication with the patients regarding their funds.&nbsp;           Especially for chronic illness, or infection, when you want them to           comply with a treatment of a certain duration, the cost of the medicine           may be greater than what they can afford.&nbsp; Occasionally, I have had to           lower a treatment duration from 10 days to 7 days, or change to a less           expensive medicine in order to accommodate what a patient can afford.&nbsp;           We do not give medicine away, so that the Clinic may be           self-sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Some patients will tell you they           have no money, when in reality, they do have some resources to buy           medicine.&nbsp; The staff in the Clinic (Rita and Amanda) have knowledge of           certain individuals, and their level of poverty, and will let you know           if a patient cannot buy the medicine as you have prescribed.&nbsp; For the           extremely poor patients, who would not be able to afford the treatments,           Amanda is doing a guinea pig/rabbit breeding project, breeding and then           selling the animals to produce funds for the people who could not afford           their treatments otherwise.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to some patients, they receive           a little financial boost thanks to this project. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Signs" id="Signs"></a>Vital Signs and Medical Records </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> In my year here, we have begun           to do complete sets of vital signs, and I hope this practice will be           continued.&nbsp; I have found every vital sign to be useful in thinking about           each patient.&nbsp; For example, the weights are helpful, as many patients           feel they are without appetite, and you can use the weight trend to           point out if they are losing or gaining.&nbsp; Simple, I know, but the           patients are unaware of their weights, as they have no way to weight           themselves at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, the nurses are only getting a measure           of temperature on people who have a history of fever, although some           people fall through the cracks, and never have the measurement done.&nbsp; (I           am unclear why we cannot do temperature measurements on all the           patients.)<br />
			<br />
			We have recently received a child&rsquo;s blood pressure cuff, and I encourage           doing complete vitals signs on the child as well, INCLUDING blood           pressure, which is not something that we were able to do previously. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The nurses know to do a rectal           temperature on an infant.&nbsp; For respiratory rates in an infant, you must           count for 30 seconds to account for periodic breathing.  </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Please continue my practice           of plotting the children on growth charts.&nbsp;           Being a pediatrician, I have found the growth charts to rule out a           variety of serious illnesses, in addition to vitamin deficiencies, in           addition to allaying parents&rsquo; fears that their children are not growing           well.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the children of Ecuador tend to be shorter than           those in the US, especially when they are of the indigenous Shuar or           Saraguro cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that you can do is to measure both           parents, and calculate a midparental height.&nbsp; If only one parent           accompanies the child, I measure that parent&rsquo;s height and make a mark on           the growth chart.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Please see the section on           Special Pediatric Considerations to have a more detailed description of           working up growth problems in children. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Right now, our system of filing           the charts can be a bit aggravating.&nbsp; I have never been allowed to touch           the filing, in order that it not be confused more than it already is.&nbsp;           We often lose charts, or they are in the incorrect location, and this           can be frustrating when following a chronic patient, and for the amount           of time lost on busy days spent waiting on a missing chart.&nbsp; We have           been brainstorming ways to improve the charting system, but so far have           not implemented any changes, for a variety of complicating factors.&nbsp; The           patients have two first names and last names, and if they do not give           all four names, we may not find the correct chart, start a new chart on           the same patient, or lose their chart altogether.&nbsp; Sometimes the           patients may give a different name in order that you not find their           chart, so that they can get another medicine!&nbsp; In addition, the patients           have a cedula number to identify them, but they do not always carry the           card with the number, thus at times, even though it may be able to serve           like a Social Security Number, the patient may not have committed the           number to memory.&nbsp; There have been times when charts have been lost, or           exams that have been done, not documented.&nbsp; I have done my best to           document as much as possible, but sometimes, all the documentation is           lost in our mountains of charts. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Right now, we are trying to keep           all the notes from general medicine and any medical specialists together           in one chart, with the exception of eye and dental charts being           separate.&nbsp; I have found this to be extremely helpful in treating           patients, as often, they do not remember what medicine or diagnosis the           specialist gave.&nbsp; With the plan to have more specialists, I hope that           this practice will be continued, as having five different charts on one           person makes the filing difficult and does not allow all of the medical           personnel to have the complete information on the patient, nor           collaborate together.&nbsp; The system is far from perfect, as oftentimes,           new charts are started when a patient already has an existing chart, but           little by little, it is improving. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Illness" id="Illness"></a>Perception of Illness </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Because of the language and           cultural barrier, it is even more important to me to take the time with           the patients so that they understand my treatments.&nbsp; They will then be           more likely to follow them.&nbsp; For that reason, I try to be very complete           in my explanations of the disease, whether it is curable or the symptoms           can be expected to occur, when they should follow up, and exactly how           they need to take the medicine.&nbsp; The more that you can explain to the           patients, the more likely they will succeed in following your treatment           plan and following up. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> It was clear to me when I first           began to work here that the patients think of you as a failure if you do           not cure their disease.&nbsp; This is a concept that they have regarding           illness, that everything can be cured.&nbsp; The most common example is           arthritis.&nbsp; The people have never been told that arthritis does not have           a cure, only medicine to treat and calm the pain.&nbsp; When they understand           that a medicine exists to help them, and they can return when they           finish the medicine that you have given, they are more likely to come           back, instead of thinking that you have failed. </p>

		<p class="erfahrung"> This environment can be tough in           encouraging follow-up for a multitude of reasons.&nbsp; First of all, it may           be costly and time consuming for a patient to follow-up.&nbsp; If a patient           has to travel for 4 or 6 hours to get here, they may not come.&nbsp; This can           be an issue, for example, to the dentists, when they put in a drain, and           need the patient to follow up to have the drain removed.&nbsp; If the           patient starts to feel better after the initiation of treatment, they           may not come back.&nbsp; For me, an example would be a patient that I           have done an incision and drainage of an abscess.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I ask the patient           to come back in several days, he may not, if the antibiotics are helping           him to get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sutured many lacerations, only to find that           the patients do not come back to have their sutures out.&nbsp; This also           occurs with chronic illnesses such as hypertension:&nbsp; when the patient&rsquo;s           hypertensive headache is relieved by your medicine, he may not come           back, if he does not understand that once he suspends the medicine, his           headache will return. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Oftentimes, the feedback part of           patient care is lacking.&nbsp; Most of us in medicine like to see our           patients after they have been helped by our treatments, but in the cases           where our patients are better by our treatments here, they will not come           back.&nbsp; Sometimes, also, a patient that has not gotten better with a           treatment may switch to another doctor and not give you another chance           to make them better.&nbsp; Stress that you want the patient to return if they           are not feeling better, and they just might. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Transport" id="Transport"></a>Transport of Care </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> In cases where you think that a           patient needs a higher level of care or admission to a hospital, you may           meet some resistance on the part of the patient to go to the hospital.&nbsp;           The perception of the hospital here is different than what you may be           used to:&nbsp; I would go to the hospital for more intense treatment, a           higher level of testing, and better around the clock care.&nbsp; For the           people here, they go to the hospital to die, and thus only in the most           grave of cases are they agreeable to go.&nbsp; This has been frustrating to           me at times, when I have felt limited in what I have been able to do           with the resources that are available in the Clinic.&nbsp; I do not recommend           practicing outside of your abilities, but at the same time, remember           that the patients have more TRUST in you than they do in the hospitals.&nbsp;           Oftentimes, they may not be admitted to the hospital without paying a           fee up front, or bringing along the medicines that they need for their           treatment.&nbsp; Thus, in some ways, what you can provide is better than what           a doctor in a hospital can do.&nbsp; Also, you may send a patient to the           hospital, where you already have the correct treatment in mind for the           patient to receive.&nbsp; The patient may go, and receive another treatment           entirely.&nbsp; For example, I had a patient with a closed head injury after           a fall from a stairwell.&nbsp; Immediately after the incident, she had           cervical neck pain, aniscocoria, headache, and nausea.&nbsp; I sent her to           the hospital for neck Xrays, and a CT scan if possible.&nbsp; They instead           did skull Xrays to rule out a skull fracture, and took her out of the           neck brace in which I had placed her without neck Xrays.&nbsp; So treatments           that may seem obvious to you in your own country are not necessarily           practiced here.&nbsp; Another example:&nbsp; a patient who was sent with a fixed           immobile neck mass for a cancer evaluation, who received an ultrasound           and antibiotics, without a biopsy nor pathology evaluation.&nbsp; FOR THAT           REASON, I NOW SEND PATIENTS WITH A REFERRAL LETTER DESCRIBING MY           DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS, WHAT TESTS I WOULD LIKE, AND WHAT TREATMENT I           INITIATED, IF ANY. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The closest hospital is in           Zamora, an hour away by bus.&nbsp; Remember that the patient is then subject           to the bus schedule, and a bumpy unpaved road to the hospital.&nbsp; There           are hospitals in Loja, 2-3 hours away by bus.&nbsp; In this region, the           people seem to consider the medical care in Cuenca to be superior, a           city that is 8 hours away by bus, and often the poorest patients cannot           afford this. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> <span class="erfahrung">Some examples of this attitude           towards hospitals over the course of my time here: </span></p>
		<ol>
			<li class="erfahrung"> My very first day of work,           a Saraguro man came with blackened necrotic fingertips on the 3rd           and 4th digits on his Right hand.&nbsp; He had suffered a partial           amputation, and another doctor had sutured the ends shut, causing           swollen deadened fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted him to the go to the hospital to           have debridement of the necrotic fingertips, but when he refused to go,           I did a digital nerve block and did it myself.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    The care of pregnant women is free in the hospital.&nbsp; Thus, I have           encouraged women to have their deliveries in the hospital, as if           something were to go wrong, we are limited in our abilities here.&nbsp;&nbsp; One           night at 10 PM, we were called to a woman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She was in labor,           and had refused to go to the hospital beforehand for her delivery.&nbsp; By           the time that we reached her house, it would have been too risky to           transport her.&nbsp; So, I, with the help of the nurse Amanda, attended a           delivery, in a shack, without electricity, with two candles to guide us.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    I had a 17 year old patient come in a week after cutting his leg           on his machete.&nbsp; His mother had gotten a prescription for Naproxen and           Penicillin, but only bought the Naproxen.&nbsp; The boy came in with a red,           swollen, hot leg, draining pus.&nbsp; The mother was more concerned regarding           putting natural oils on his leg than understanding the medicines that I           had prescribed, and refused to take him to the hospital, saying that           there was not enough money.&nbsp; This put me in a tough spot:&nbsp; If I           continued to give IV injections or oral medications, I was letting her           get away with not going to the hospital, giving her the message that I           would keep giving him medicine, even though he may have eventually           worsened.&nbsp; Eventually, after 24 hours of talking to her and trying to           tell her that he could die from this infection, the uncle intervened to           take him, and he remained hospitalized for 2 months getting debridements           of his leg.

		<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Social" id="Social"></a>Common Social Problems </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Not unique to this area of the           world, a variety of social problems exist, which may or may not be more           prevalent here that what you may be used to.&nbsp; In addition, the cultural           differences may add another layer of difficulty in treating these           problems. </p>
		<ol>
			<li class="erfahrung"> Alcoholism:&nbsp; Recently, there has been a town meeting in Guadalupe           to address this exact problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people here drink a great deal, but           I have found them to be rarely honest with the quantity of alcohol they           are drinking.&nbsp; They answer &ldquo;De repente, de repente&rdquo; (meaning every once           in awhile), but then I see them passed out on the Hanging Bridge several           days later.&nbsp; A LOT OF BINGE DRINKING OCCURS.&nbsp; Family members           occasionally are enablers of this drinking, either participating with           the alcoholic, or not being honest that a real problem exists.&nbsp; I have           seen cases of alcoholic withdrawal, but they are difficult to treat, as           the patients often do not follow-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Domestic Violence:&nbsp; The cases of domestic violence that I have           heard over the course of the year are some of the saddest aspects of           working in Guadalupe.&nbsp; The low status of women, their lack of education,           their inability to find work outside the home to provide for themselves           and a large brood of children, all contribute to women often being           powerless to defend themselves against the violence of men, or to leave           when they are victims of violence.&nbsp; Because of the culture of machismo,           in addition to the teachings of the Church, women are not encouraged to           leave an abusive situation.&nbsp; They are also hesitant to speak up that           abuse occurs.&nbsp; Being in a situation where little resources exist to help           the women escape makes helping them difficult, so I at least try to ask           the questions regarding abuse so that the women are aware that I care           about the issue, even if I have little to offer to better the           situation.&nbsp; We are hoping to offer self defense classes in the future,           and have been trying to do education with men regarding alcoholism and           abuse.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Sexual Abuse and Rape:&nbsp; Over the course of my year, I have had           several women confess to me that they had been raped as teenagers or           abused as children.&nbsp; Invariably, the women are ashamed and have not           confessed to family members that the abuse has occurred.&nbsp; In most cases,           the victim is blamed for the abuse, thus making them afraid to speak out           that the abuse even occurred.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to speak to           some parents regarding their children who were abused, and help them           understand that putting the blame on their children is the incorrect           method.&nbsp; In addition, in this conservatively Catholic country, many           people can barely even name the private parts, nor talk openly about           sex, which makes bringing this topic out into the open more difficult.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Machismo:&nbsp;&nbsp; It exists.&nbsp; I may be an educated foreign doctor, but           I still get catcalls in the halls of the Clinic from men who think this           is an appropriate way to get my attention.&nbsp; In the town of Guadalupe, as           well, men will whistle or hiss.&nbsp; It is also surprising to me how little           the women expect from the men here.&nbsp; For example, if you ask if they are           in a monogamous relationship, the women cannot tell you for sure.&nbsp; There           is always some level of mistrust of the fidelity of the men.&nbsp; The men           who leave, for example, to work in Spain, for a time, tell me that they           cannot be expected to go without female companionship, thus breaking           their wedding vows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Teen Pregnancy:&nbsp; People initiate sexual activity when they are           still teenagers, and it has not been unusual to see 16 year olds who are           having their second babies.&nbsp; Especially for the young girls, who have           little chance of education if they do not learn birth control or           abstinence, they become unmarried single mothers, often with the fathers           of their children providing little or no support in the care of the           children they make together.&nbsp; There is little understanding of birth           control, and little desire by the men to use it.&nbsp; Boys of 16 or 17 years           old are already paying for the services of prostitutes, and not using           condoms.		<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]>&nbsp;

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Sexually Transmitted Diseases:&nbsp; I have seen a variety of STDS in           the Clinic, from genital warts to chancroid to Trichomonas.&nbsp; I believe           that we probably under-diagnose PID.&nbsp; The patients are uneducated about           STDS, and when asked if they had one in the past, often cannot give you           a clearcut answer.&nbsp; In a recent conference on HIV in the region, it was           noted that there are 15 cases of HIV in the Zamora-Chinchipe region.&nbsp; I           have sent many patients to have the test done, but so far have not found           any positives.&nbsp; As mentioned above, with the large number of boys who           confess using the services of prostitutes without the protection of           condoms, I am very fearful that HIV could explode in this region.&nbsp; From           what people have told me, prostitution is legal here and the legal           prostitutes are card-carrying, being tested every several months for           STDs.&nbsp; However, in the countryside where we are located, I doubt that           all prostitution is occurring legally.&nbsp;<br />

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Birth Control:&nbsp; As a Mission Clinic, we do not have birth control           available to give the people.&nbsp; Oftentimes, patients do want to discuss           birth control, and I have felt free to do that, using medical statistics           regarding which methods are most reliable.&nbsp; However, if the patient           wants a form of birth control, we do not have it in the Clinic.&nbsp; In           Zamora, one hour away, a clinic named Aprofe receives patients who are           interested in birth control, and offers a variety of methods.&nbsp;

		<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Complaints" id="Complaints"></a>Common Chief Complaints </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> To give you a better idea of           some of the medical complaints that you will be facing, here is a list           of common complaints, and perceptions of illness. </p>
		<ol>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Probably the number one thing that I see is musculoskeletal pain,           the most common being low back pain.&nbsp; The patient may come in with           &ldquo;dolor de los riñones&rdquo; or kidney pain.&nbsp; They think that this pain comes           from their kidneys, and that kidney pain also manifests itself as           burning with urination, and burning of the feet.&nbsp; When I have seen how           hard the people work, carrying logs on their backs, macheting for the           whole day in the hot sun, walking for hours to reach their farms, miners           bent over in a tunnel all day, it is not surprising how much pain they           have.&nbsp; You may treat their pain now, but chances are, with their way of           working, the pain will return.&nbsp; I usually try to include some stretching           or exercises as part of treatment.&nbsp; In addition, I am probably more           liberal than most with the muscle relaxants, but I really think a lot of           the people have back spasm.&nbsp; I also try to be really clear that the pain           does NOT come from their kidneys, but their muscles that are tense from           their heavy labor.&nbsp; When you take the time to explain, it helps them in           the future not accept &ldquo;kidney treatments&rdquo; from other doctors.&nbsp; I also           try to explain very clearly that the pain does not come from a vitamin           deficiency, thus receiving vitamin shots does nothing to help the           problem.&nbsp; Musculoskeletal pain is probably the most common reason that           other doctors prescribe Vitamin B shots, so it pays to take the time to           do some health education in this area.&nbsp; In addition, I always try to           include some sort of exercise or stretching regimen to avoid the pain           coming back in the future.

				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Dysuria:&nbsp; I have seen lots of patients with chronic complaints of           dysuria, but the urine screening exam is usually negative for           infection.&nbsp; I think that the patients have such concentrated urine for           lack of hydrating themselves while working in the hot sun, that their           urine burns.&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<![endif]>
				<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Bitter taste in mouth (&ldquo;boca amarga&rdquo;), bruxism, bad breath (&ldquo;mal           aliento&rdquo;):&nbsp; These complaints are all thought to be due to parasites or           liver problems.&nbsp; Most of the time, bad breath can be attributed to poor           dental hygiene, lack of brushing the teeth, and lack of taking out their           dentures AT ALL for cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a parasite treatment has not been           given in 6 months, I will also treat for parasites.&nbsp; Also consider           Giardia and reflux in the differential diagnosis.

				<![endif]>	<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Dizziness (&ldquo;mareos&rdquo;):&nbsp; The patients think that this is due to           elevated cholesterol, but often may have evidence of high blood           pressure, arrhythmia, or orthostasis.
				&nbsp;
				<![endif]>	<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">&ldquo;Nervios&rdquo;:&nbsp; The patients often think that they suffer from           &ldquo;nervios,&rdquo; meaning that they are people who are very easily frightened,           sensitive, anxious.&nbsp; Parents often call their children &ldquo;muy nervioso&rdquo;           for many reasons:&nbsp; if the child cannot study well, if they scare easily,           if the mother was in bad mood when she was pregnant with that child. &nbsp;It           seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy more than anything else.&nbsp; These           patients tend to be very dramatic, and even worse, completely certain           that something is wrong with them.&nbsp; With the parents, I try to talk           about not putting these &ldquo;nervous&rdquo; ideas into the child&rsquo;s heads, as I           have seen children faking attacks and fainting spells, from &ldquo;nervios,&rdquo;           when in reality, they were having problems with a brother leaving for           work in Spain.&nbsp; Other times, I have found people with real depression or           anxiety problems that needed medical treatment.&nbsp; I try to explain that           &ldquo;nervios&rdquo; as an illness in its own right does not exist, and there is           usually a problem in the home, within a marriage, other stress that           causes physical symptoms.&nbsp; I joke with them that the custom here is to           say &ldquo;nervios&rdquo; but a real illness with that name does not exist, and that           they have to examine their lives to find out from where the stress           comes.&nbsp; The people understand when you explain it to them in this           manner.
				&nbsp;
				<![endif]>	<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Fever:&nbsp; Patients often call the site of their pain a source of           &ldquo;fiebre.&rdquo;&nbsp; They may not have had a real fever, and they have no way to           measure their temperature at home.&nbsp; For example, a patient with           gastritis may say that he has a fever in his belly, or a woman with a           headache may say that she has a fever in her head.&nbsp; It takes a little           further questioning to figure out if this was a real fever or not.&nbsp;           Complicating matters is the fact that the nurses do not get temperatures           on all patients, only those that report fever, thus probably missing           some patients with real fever.
				&nbsp;
				<![endif]>	<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">&ldquo;Aire&rdquo;:&nbsp; Patients use the term &ldquo;aire&rdquo; as a possible reason that           they have various complaints.&nbsp; They do not use this to describe problems           with breathing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness.&nbsp; They say that           they have headache and the reason is &ldquo;falta de aire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
				<![endif]>	<br />
				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    VITAMINS:&nbsp; Usually at the end of the visit, a patient will slip           in that they need vitamins.&nbsp; Some patients are up front, blaming their           chief complaints on a &ldquo;lack of vitamins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like I have mentioned           numerous times before, I tend to NOT give vitamins to feed into this           desire for vitamins, when probably they are not necessary, when           education on the balanced diet is sufficient.&nbsp; I tell the patients that           the custom here is to focus a great deal of attention on vitamins, when           at the same time, they need to remember that other things are           essential:&nbsp; calories to give energy and force to the body, and proteins,           fats, carbohydrates which play their own role in maintaining health.&nbsp; I           tell them that to focus only on vitamins is not correct, and only the           DIET can give them everything that they need.&nbsp; This is another instance           that spending several minutes on health education can pay off.&nbsp; It would           be easy to write the patient off by giving them vitamins, but then we           are forgetting our responsibility to educate.

				<br />
				</li>
			<li class="erfahrung">                    Lack of appetite:&nbsp; This is probably the most common reason that           parents bring their children in.&nbsp; When you do further questioning, you           realize that yes, the children do have appetite, but are satisfying           their hunger with candy, cola, sweets, and then have no room to eat           food.&nbsp; With these parents, I talk about restricting sweets, review the           balanced diet, and give a parasite medication.&nbsp; I review the child&rsquo;s           growth chart with the parents to show them that the child is growing           normally, thus is receiving enough nutrition to maintain a normal           weight.&nbsp; I DO NOT GIVE VITAMINS unless there is a clearcut growth           deficiency.&nbsp; And I ask the parents to follow up every 6 months for a           measurement of the growth, and to repeat the parasite medication.

			<li class="erfahrung"> Growth Problems in Children <br />
				<br />
				If a           child is small on the growth chart, there are a variety of things to           consider.&nbsp; There is nutritional and organic failure to thrive, and it is           very RARE to see a case of organic failure to thrive.<br />
				<br />
				The           first step in evaluating a small child is to do a midparental height.&nbsp;           To do a midparental height, add 5 inches to the height of the mother in a           boy patient, OR subtract 5 inches from the height of the father in a girl           patient to account for sex difference.&nbsp; Average the corrected heights of           both parents.&nbsp; This is the midparental height.&nbsp; Mark this on the growth           chart.&nbsp; In general, this is the height that the child can be expected to           fulfill, accounting for the heredity from both parents.&nbsp; Most children           are growing in accordance with this midparental height, making them           small for the hereditary of their parents. <br />
				<br />
				If           you are worried about the initial short stature or low weight of a           child, look to see if they are symmetric.&nbsp; A child low on weight and           normal on height (or disproportion height and weight) LACKS CALORIES.&nbsp;           The parents may want vitamins, but are better off encouraging high           calorie foods, such as milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, eggs, peanut           butter, avocadoes, and beans.&nbsp; I do not start vitamins right away in           these cases, but discuss a change in the diet.&nbsp; (The parents can add           extra cheese and margarine to all that the kid eats.)&nbsp; I am more likely           to start a nutritional supplement (powder added to milk or water to give           vitamins AND CALORIES) rather than just vitamins, again, trying to avoid           this thought that vitamins cure all.&nbsp; I try to STRESS CALORIES. <br />
				<br />
				If           the child is proportional, they may be short and thin for familial           reasons, and I recommend to follow up with them in 2 to 3 months to           remeasure a height and weight, and follow their growth velocity. <br />

			<li><span class="erfahrung"> I have left a Pediatric Drug             Dosing Handbook in addition to a Harriet Lane.&nbsp; We dose medicine by             weight.&nbsp;<br />
				Some common illnesses with dosages:&nbsp; <br />
				</span>
				<ul>
					<li class="erfahrung">cute Otitis Media with or without perforation:&nbsp; Amoxicillin 80 mg/kg           divided BID for 10 days (first line), Augmentin 45 mg/kg divided BID for           10 days (second line), 2nd generation cephalosporin (3rd           line).&nbsp; With a perforation, I add a quinolone ear drop (or eye drop           depending on what is available) with an ear wick.&nbsp; In older children, 3           to 5 years old, it is fine to decrease the length of duration of           treatment to 5 to 7 days, if that makes it easy with the medication           supply and concentrations that we have.<br />
						<br />
						</li>
					<li class="erfahrung">UTI:&nbsp; Think of UTI in young girls, especially, or uncircumcised males           less than 1 year of age, especially with vomiting, diarrhea and fever.&nbsp;           Bactrim would be a good drug choice, in addition to Amoxicillin or           Cephalexin<br />
						<br />
						</li>
					<li class="erfahrung">					Diarrhea:&nbsp; There is a lot of chronic diarrhea.&nbsp; With vomiting, I more           likely think of acute gastroenteritis.&nbsp; Without vomiting, chronicnonspecific diarrhea of childhood is more common, and caused by too many soups and juices and coladas, instead of fatty foods and milk.&nbsp;Parasites are also something to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute diarrhea with blood would point to infectious diarrhea, and a good choice would be bactrim.&nbsp;           Treatment of infectious diarrhea with antibiotics has a slight risk of HUS (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome).<br />
						<br />
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		<ul>
			<ul>
				<li class="erfahrung">Parasites:&nbsp; In less than 2 year olds, we use Piperazine (Lombrizina),           as the parasites can travel per the esophagus and asphyxiate a child.&nbsp;           Piperazine has a paralytic which renders the parasites unable to move.&nbsp;           In greater than 2 year old child, we use Albendazole 400 mg.

		<p class="erfahrung"> On occasion, emergencies have           shown up and needed stabilization or initial treatment before transport           to the hospital.&nbsp; We are limited in our capabilities to do much in these           situations, secondary to inadequate nursing care/support help,           medicines, and equipment.</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> We do have a crash cart.&nbsp; When I           arrived, the crash cart had a resuscitation kit with smelling salts, and           glucose gel, from 1992, and that was it!!!&nbsp; In the course of this year,           we have restocked the crash cart as best we could with our supplies.&nbsp;           The crash cart now has several vials of epinephrine, atropine,           lidocaine, insulin, and glucose tablets.&nbsp; We kept the smelling salts for           good measure.&nbsp; We also have IV starting equipment, including           intraosseous needles and central line kits.&nbsp; We have one thoracotomy           tray.&nbsp; For airway management, we have ET tubes of various sizes (none           pediatric), oral airways, nasopharyngeal airways, a laryngoscope and bag           mask capability.&nbsp; WE DO NOT HAVE OXYGEN. </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Mission" id="Mission"></a>Living at a Mission </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Living and working in Guadalupe           is a unique experience all its own.&nbsp; You are living at a Catholic           Mission with an international flavor, and I am sure that this is one of           the few missions that exists in the world with such an international           crew.&nbsp; In my time, we have had nationals from the US, Ecuador, Colombia,           Austria, Germany, Italy, and Ireland.&nbsp; We speak Spanish, English, and           German.&nbsp; People of a variety of religious faiths have lived and worked           in the Mission. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> First and foremost, you are           living in a Catholic Mission, and will be eating your meals and spending           time with Sisters of the Teresita order of nuns.&nbsp; A great side benefit           of working in Guadalupe is the chance to know the Sisters, talk with           them, and spend time with them.&nbsp; They have a wonderful sense of humor,           and are very caring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Padre Jorge, the priest who founded the Clinic           and who has lived in Guadalupe for over 10 years, is a very           approachable, fun, and understanding person, who is very appreciative of           all the work that you do.&nbsp; Part of the most enjoyable part of working           here is becoming a part of this unique family. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Because you are living at a           Catholic mission, prayers are said before and after meals, and Catholic           Mass is often held at the Church near the Clinic.&nbsp; You are welcome to           attend Mass, but it is not a requirement.&nbsp; Being a non-Catholic myself,           I have enjoyed participating in the religious aspect of life here,           because it is an important part of the culture of the patients, and my           friends here.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> That being said, oftentimes, the           rigidity of the schedule of the Convent can oftentimes be a bit           oppressive.&nbsp; The meals are at 7:30, 12:00 and 6 PM every day, and when           the Clinic schedule is full, you may not leave until 6 PM.&nbsp; I have           occasionally enjoyed taking a day to myself, to cook for myself in the           Residence, or take some time to go for a walk or play basketball before           dinner.&nbsp; Thus, guard your free time, if you like to exercise, cook, or           just want a day off to eat on your own, feel free to do that.&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="tothetopdivtag"><a href="#Orientationguide">To the top</a></div>
	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Residence" id="Residence"></a>The Volunteers&rsquo; Residence </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> You will live with the other           volunteers at the Mission in a less than 2 year old residence behind the           Clinic.&nbsp; There are single and double rooms, each with its own bathroom.&nbsp;           There is a kitchen in the Residence, equipped with the basics in order           to cook, including refrigerator, stove, oven and microwave.&nbsp; We do have           a TV with a VCR, in addition to a computer, with internet access.&nbsp; We           recently got a generous gift of a DVD player from two former volunteers           (and good friends of mine).&nbsp; In addition, we are lucky to have a washing           machine for the clothing, which we then hang to dry on a clothesline. </p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Compared to how the people live           in the town of Guadalupe, we are living in comparative luxury!&nbsp; Every           once in awhile, just to remind us of how lucky we are, the power will go           out, or the water will go low.&nbsp; Then we appreciate so much more all that           we do have in the Residence! </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Climate" id="Climate"></a>The Climate </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> The weather here can change in           the blink of an eye:&nbsp; it is unpredictable!&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> This region of Ecuador is           particularly humid during the day, and can be cold at night.&nbsp; Be           prepared for cold weather, with layers of fleece, long sleeve shirts,           and pants.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the women, I have been able to wear shorts in town to           play basketball and go on hikes without problems.&nbsp; Layers are probably           sufficient; it is not so cold that you need a winter jacket.&nbsp; Definitely           bring gear for the rain!&nbsp; We have a supply of rubber boots that reach           the knee that you can borrow during your time here to hike.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Because of the humidity, we are           constantly battling mold.&nbsp; Mold forms very easily and clothes, your           suitcase, anything that is left out in your room.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to           find mold forming on clothes left outside to dry, shoes left in your           room…. Sometimes it feels like a losing battle!!  </p>

	<h4 class="erfahrung"><a name="Vision" id="Vision"></a>My Vision for the Clinic </h4>
		<p class="erfahrung"> Working here for a year has been           challenging, but rewarding.&nbsp; I have learned a great deal about myself,           raised my confidence level as a doctor and pediatrician practicing on           her own, and come to understand a great deal about the culture and           practices here.&nbsp; From my year here, and being the first longstanding           doctor volunteer, I have a special personal investment in the Clinic and           in the manner in which I would like to see it progress.&nbsp; Padre Jorge has           set a vision that we will provide a standard of care above and beyond           what is here in Zamora Chinchipe, and I second this high ideal.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> I have seen the Clinic grow a           great deal in my year here.&nbsp; We saw the first eye and ENT surgeries           performed in our operating rooms.&nbsp; We expanded our patient population by           thousands as the word of our quality care continues to grow.&nbsp; We have           had a growth in the number of volunteers.&nbsp; We have renovated the nursing           station with paintings on the wall for children, added bookcases to           various rooms, CLEANED OUT A LOT OF JUNK.&nbsp; In addition, we have           increased in our efforts to do basic health education as part of the           medical visits, with emphasis on balanced diet rather than vitamins,           wound care, exercise, care of the body while working.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> However, in some ways, we are           still lacking, and could do better.&nbsp; Obviously, we are working in a           different environment than what we may be used to in our own homes, as           our patients travel for hours to receive our care, may not be able to           return expeditiously to follow up on treatment, and the cultural barrier           may at times be difficult.&nbsp; In the future, we hope to expand the lab and           have higher level of nursing care to help Amanda.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="erfahrung"> First of all, I think we should           have a level of pride regarding the quality care that we provide.&nbsp; The           following are things that I have been fighting for in my time here, and           with my leaving, I hope that I can leave this mission to you, those who           follow me, in helping this Clinic to be all that it can be.&nbsp; That being           said, I would like to see us really strive to raise it another notch in           three ways: <br />
			<br />
			</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="erfahrung"> For everything that we can do, do it to the best of our ability.&nbsp;           For example, doing complete vital signs on every patient, a simple           intervention, yet so pertinent to quality care, needs to be continued.&nbsp;           When we withhold doing the things that can be done easily for lack of           time or patience, such as vital signs, we are not providing quality           care.&nbsp; When we do lab tests, do them correctly:&nbsp; clean catch midstream           urines were not being done until I instructed the nurses how to do           them.&nbsp; Obese people were having blood pressures done with a normal adult           cuff.&nbsp; This is BASIC MEDICAL CARE, and when we fail to do this           correctly, we are failing in our mission.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    The Clinic should strive to have the best and CORRECT care for           the patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oftentimes, I see us practicing a bit of hypocrisy, and           slowly slowly slowly things are changing.&nbsp; One example:&nbsp; we tell the           patients to brush their teeth and not eat sweets, yet we only recently           decided to stop selling candy in the pharmacy after much debate and           discussion.&nbsp; (The dentists who have recently filled cavities LOVE           this.)&nbsp; Thankfully the change occurred, but it has been a long time in           coming, and we now have sugar free cookies and candies at the pharmacy.&nbsp;           Another example:&nbsp; I preach against vitamin shots, yet we have them in           the pharmacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, other doctors are using the pharmacy and           prescribing things like Vitamin B shots, and for that reason, we           continue to buy Vitamin B shots, but my hope is that in the future, the           people will be educated enough to NOT WANT these things.&nbsp; It would be my           hope that the Clinic will stop carrying worthless medicines that waste           the patients´ money, and are bought from anyone other than a certified           drug representative.&nbsp; We cannot save nor attend to everyone in the           region, but we can set an example of the medicine that we will and will           not carry, setting a standard for what medicines work and what does           not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The WHO and Doctors without Borders both have guidelines for           pharmacies that can be used to help us in making decisions on what           medicines to buy, although many of the medicines that we receive in           donations are much more sophisticated that the basics that they have           listed.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Health Education is very important, and basic health concepts           like vitamins, balanced diet, wound care, growth, pregnancy, women&rsquo;s           issues, alcoholism, all are very important and pertinent to what we do.&nbsp;           I hope that this may be continued, with more outreach into the barrios           to educate the people regarding these basic health fundamentals.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is           important to stress these things in treatment discussions with the           patients, as I try to tell them that these things are just as important,           and less expensive, than buying a lot of medicine.

			<li class="erfahrung">                    Right now, when we have specialists arriving, the Clinic is           understaffed to deal with the large crowds of people waiting, and the           Clinic staff is stretched even thinner when the volunteer doctors do not           speak Spanish.&nbsp; It would be nice to see additional nursing help and two           doctors at all times to attend sufficiently to the people.&nbsp; It would be           nice to have one qualified and up to date nurse who can help with the           growing laboratory&nbsp; and patient support needs, and two doctors who can           attend patients and collaborate with each other.&nbsp; Amanda is currently           serving as nurse, pharmacist, translator, lab tech, and all around           support person, and is overworked. </li>

		<p class="erfahrung"> I have put a lot of time and           thought, to the best of my ability, into these patients, but I am sure           that I made mistakes over the course of my time here.&nbsp; I am a           pediatrician who has been seeing kids of all ages, and when I started, a           little out of practice with hypertension, type II diabetes, menopause.&nbsp;           I hope that my notes have been complete and helpful, and my suggestions           useful.&nbsp;</p>
