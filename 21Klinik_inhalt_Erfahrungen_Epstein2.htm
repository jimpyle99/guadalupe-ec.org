      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">We were at the Mission Clinic for one week in 
        December 2001 when it opened. There is a local physician Dr. Jaime Ortiz 
        who has been hired to attend once per week. There have been a stream of 
        foreign dentists and last week 4 physicians from a city 3 hours away. 
        The clinic has examining rooms, 2 dental rooms complete with dental 
        x-ray, a surgical suite including a scrub room and recovery, and a 
        pharmacy. The surgical area is not yet functional. Although the pharmacy 
        has limitations we were able to treat most of what we saw. The clinic 
        may soon have a basic laboratory. There is x-ray, laboratory, and 
        surgical services in a city (Loja) 2 hours away for the few who can 
        afford it and when the road is passable.</p>
        <p align="justify">The people were indiginous subsistance farmers with a 
        few shopkeepers and miners. The gold mines are about one hour away. The 
        oil companies are not in this particular region. There is malaria in the 
        general area but little in the immediate vacinity. Similarly we did not 
        see dengue or yellow fever. Mosquitos were present but not in great 
        numbers. The water is not clean and that coupled with often the people 
        sharing accomodations with their animals, giardia and worms were 
        endemic. We saw some acute diarrhea and perhaps one person with typhoid 
        fever. Many people had back pain (called kidney problems!) as well as 
        depression, alcoholism, hypertension, and children with chronic ruptured 
        tympanic membranes. We also saw all manner of other medical illness from 
        dysfunctional vaginal bleeding to rheumatoid arthritis to parkinsonism 
        to kidney stones. Some access to birth control is available in the city. 
        Remarkably some people of greater means came from the city to this 
        jungle clinic for second opinion, records in hand. Surgical supplies 
        were present for suturing, draining, packing and casting, but analgesics 
        and local anesthetics were deficient. Hopefully this has been rectified. 
        The examining rooms are equipt but you may wish to bring a portable 
        ophthalmoscope/otoscope as a backup as well as a glucometer, gloves, 
        gel, and hemoccult cards.</p>
        <p align="justify">The parish is clean and accommodations quite 
        comfortable with our own rooms and hot shower. The Nuns supplied us with 
        preboiled water to drink and hearty meals safe to eat. We even felt 
        comfortable eating the salads served to us by them, usually not a good 
        idea in this setting. The Padre is from Austria. He has done remarkable 
        things for his people in a place where the church does the social 
        service tasks that are usually the purvue of the government. The 
        government gives vaccinations sporatically and thus far this is not 
        being performed by the clinic but perhaps in the future. The village is 
        in the high tropical jungle along the main trade route to the amazon in 
        Ecuador. It is poor but beautiful. I suggest that you be up to date for 
        dT, polio, hepatitis a+b, and obtain yellow fever vaccine. You will need 
        malaria prophyllaxis. I suggest a book Handbook of Medicine in 
        Developing Countries by Catherine Wolf M.D. and Dennis Palmer D.O. 
        Although mainly geared to the hospital it has usefull information in 
        table format.</p>
        <p align="justify">The weather is most pleasant. It is about 75*F during 
        the day, sometimes warmer, and 65*F at night, again sometimes warmer. It 
        rains every day. I brought scrubs and a laboratory coat to work in and 
        was most comfortable and felt adequately attired. One has to be wary of 
        crime in Quito or Guayaquil but I felt perfectly safe in Guadalupe, 
        especially as a guest of the parish mission. The currency is the US 
        dollar. It goes far in Ecuador. There is little to spend it on in the 
        village. We did not have a chance to be tourists but the beauty of the 
        surroundings and the reward of helping others who appreciated the effort 
        more than made up for it. They could use an operating microscope. If you 
        know of any institution who might be able to donate one that would be 
        terrific. That way ENT and basic Ophthalmology could be performed. Many 
        children have ruptured TM's and many adults have cataracts and 
        pterygeums.</p>
