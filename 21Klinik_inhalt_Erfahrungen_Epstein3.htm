        Today I saw a 43 year old woman, six months pregnant, afraid of her 
        alcoholic husband who beats her. The next patient was her husband... A 4 
        year old girl presents with a draining fistula from her tibia with 
        osteomyelitis and possible osteosarcoma. She does not cry. Her father 
        cannot afford to take her to an orthopedist. At an average of 20 years 
        complaint per person with vaginal discharge, all told, today I saw 200 
        years of vaginal discharge.<br>
        <br>
        I believe that here, unfortunately, family planning begins at menopause. 
        Large families are common despite the poverty. This is because of lack 
        of resources, fear of child mortality and tremendous peer pressure to 
        marry young, often to separate from parents and in order to leave home. 
        Depression is common. Being poor, working in the fields, gold mines, and 
        jungle with little help for those unable to care for themselves (at any 
        age) and with many mouths to feed with little food, does not lend to 
        merriment. <br>
        <br>
        Yet people are appreciative and enduring, with a strength and at times 
        grace that we would be unable to muster in less harsh circumstance. 
        There is music, dance, and religious festivals. And all is not without 
        humor: “Doctor, I have terrible headaches in the sun.” ...&quot;What make it 
        better?&quot; ... “I wear my sombrero.” ... &quot;Then I suggest that you wear 
        your sombrero&quot;... Many complain that their bones hurt when it is cold. 
        However, we are in the Amazon! Yet many individuals have multiple 
        problems that impact their quality of life and ability to work and 
        subsist.<br>
        <br>
        Even though the medicine we practice may give us pause in terms of 
        quality, the peasants have such tremendous problems, and so few places 
        to turn for help, that our worst efforts become models of exceptional 
        care. And the clinic that Padre has built could be placed in the middle 
        of any city in the United States and not seem out of place. The people 
        line up by the dozens to be seen. It is 10 o’clock at night and they are 
        already showing up to be seen tomorrow. We just finished our day’s work. 
        I will need to rest in order to have the energy and spirit to try to do, 
        in my own way, GOD’s work”.</font></p>
