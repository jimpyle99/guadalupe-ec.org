        </span><span lang="EN-US">Our most unique experience was on Valentine´s 
        Day</span>...</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After a long day in clinic, we 
        were asked to do a semi-urgent home visit </span>in one of the villages.
        <span lang="EN-US">We were told </span>a woman<span lang="EN-US"> was 
        passing out and bleeding after having given birth at home.&nbsp; Padre </span>
        Jorge <span lang="EN-US">dropped us off on his way to a mass, giving us 
        a dollar to catch the bus home if we got done before he could pick us 
        up.&nbsp; We walked into the house to find a 22 year old woman on a bed of 
        boards, pale as a ghost, with a baby sleeping between her legs, still 
        connected by the umbilical cord to the placenta, which was still inside 
        the woman.&nbsp; We were told she had given birth to the baby 2 hours earlier 
        and had lost a lot of blood during delivery.&nbsp; With a medical field book 
        literally laying open on the bed with us (as neither of us are trained 
        to do OB), we tried numerous maneuvers to stop the bleeding and deliver 
        the afterbirth/placenta, knowing that the nearest hospital was 1 hour 
        away.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after 30 minutes of unsuccessful efforts, we 
        realized we needed to get her to the hospital emergently as she was 
        going into shock.&nbsp; While it took the family 30 more minutes to find 
        transportation, we were able to cut the baby free from the cord using 
        thread and a razor blade.&nbsp; We carried the woman to the back of an open 
        bed truck, driven by an 11 year old boy on an empty tank of gas.&nbsp; We 
        stopped at a clinic on the way to the hospital to start IV fluids as we 
        were afraid we were going to lose her.&nbsp; The doctor at the clinic tried 
        to call an ambulance to get her to the hospital faster, but none were 
        available - so again we transported her in the back of the truck with 
        someone holding the bag of IV fluids above her head, and Craig holding 
        her to keep her warm.&nbsp; We finally made it to the hospital in Zamora 
        where she was immediately taken to the OR to have the placenta 
        surgically removed under anesthesia.&nbsp; She made it through surgery, but 
        by this point, her Hct was 10.&nbsp; Although hard to believe, the Zamora 
        hospital does not carry blood and the nearest Red Cross was an hour away 
        in Loja.&nbsp; She finally got the blood 5 hours later, after the family got 
        a loan to pay for the blood and transportation to pick it up.&nbsp; While 
        they were waiting for the blood, we realized the family&nbsp;was going to be 
        at the hospital all night, and we began wondering how we were going to 
        get home in the middle of the night, 1 1/2 hours away with a dollar.&nbsp; 
        Fortunately, a neighbor volunteered to drive us, and we made it home at 
        1 in the morning, where we devoured the best bag of microwave popcorn 
        ever for dinner.&nbsp; Somehow, she (and we) made it through this ordeal, and 
        she went home from the hospital 4 days later.&nbsp; Last we heard, she is 
        doing well, and the baby fair.<br>

&nbsp;<p><font face="Times New Roman">My wife and I, an internist and 
          physician´s assistant respectively, had the pleasure of volunteering 
          at the clinic at the Mission at Guadalupe from mid-January to 
          mid-March 2003.&nbsp; It was a great experience that we will never forget.&nbsp; 
          Our backgrounds in general internal medicine and geriatric medicine 
          were a good foundation, but one of the challenges and rewards of 
          working in an underserved area is reaching outside of your specialty 
          and comfort zone.&nbsp; For us, that meant practicing OBGYN and pediatrics 
          (please see our Valentine´s Day excerpt).&nbsp; All disciplines are needed 
          and welcomed, and word travels fast of the arrival of a new 
          specialist.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">The clinic is an incredibly modern 
          facility in the remote mountainous rainforest in southern Ecuador.&nbsp; It 
          is a vital resource for the area, as the nearest small community 
          hospital is 1 hour away, and the nearest full-service hospital is 2 
          hours away.&nbsp; The clinic includes 2 medical exam rooms with 
          sphygmomanometer, otoscope, and ophthalmoscope (although we still 
          recommend bringing a&nbsp;portable as electricity goes out often).&nbsp; The 
          exam tables have stirrups for pelvic exams.&nbsp; There are 2 dental suites 
          as well.&nbsp; The pharmacy is well stocked with a variety of international 
          medicines from the US, Austria, and Ecuador.&nbsp; The lab is in its 
          growing stages and is currently capable of doing CBCs and UAs.&nbsp; There 
          is a microscope for doing smears, and paps are sent to an outside 
          lab.&nbsp; In addition, the clinic offers vision exams and dentures.&nbsp; 
          Future projects include an OR suite for minor surgeries such as 
          cataracts, and further development of the lab.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">The clinic coordinator is Amanda 
          Anderson, an RN from California who has been working in Latin America 
          for the last 20 years.&nbsp; She is an incredible resource for questions in 
          and out of the clinic.&nbsp; She is very familiar with local customs, and 
          is also available for translating if needed.&nbsp; The front desk and 
          pharmacy are operated by Rita Japón, an energetic hard-working local 
          woman, who is a pleasure to work with as well.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">The clinic is open Monday through Friday 
          8-5, although occasionally we would do home visits outside office 
          hours.&nbsp; Scrubs are appropriate for work, and more importantly, dry 
          quickly in the humid climate.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;a few&nbsp;scrubs and lab coats 
          available from past volunteers.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">Once word had spread of our arrival, 
          30-50 patients a day would show up, some spending the night in front 
          of the clinic to guarantee a spot the next day.&nbsp; We would generally 
          see 30-40 patients a day between the 2 of us on a first-come 
          first-serve basis, although this number is flexible depending on your 
          pace.&nbsp; One of the biggest challenges is the realization that you can´t 
          see everyone on a given day, and at times, you have to be able to say 
          no.&nbsp; With the exception of parasites, which patients present with 
          frequently, we saw mostly the same chronic diseases we see in the US 
          such as HTN, T2DM, gastritis, headache, depression, and low back pain 
          (called kidney pain here by locals).&nbsp; We saw about 30% pediatrics but 
          would expect many more if a pediatrician were to come.&nbsp; There is a 
          fair amount of GYN, and derm as well (there´s a good derm book in 
          clinic as a resource).</font></div>

          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">The community of Guadalupe is about 600 
          people.&nbsp; It and the surrounding communities consist of Saraguro and 
          Shuar Indians as well as people of Spanish ancestry (called colonos).&nbsp; 
          The majority of patients come from these local communities, although 
          some travel for up to 4 hours from more remote areas.&nbsp; We found it a 
          rewarding experience to travel with Padre Jorge Nigsch and the nuns to 
          some of the surrounding villages, both to visit and do a few medical 
          consults.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">The mission has a progressive philosophy, 
          welcoming volunteers from many countries and different religious 
          backgrounds, all with the common goal of helping people here.&nbsp; One of 
          our greatest joys was spending time with German volunteers who were 
          here at the same time as us.&nbsp; The new volunteer residence, which 
          exceeded our expectations, has private bathrooms with warm showers, a 
          communal kitchen, and a large balcony with a beautiful view of the 
          mountains (our favorite spot in the dorm).&nbsp; Room and board are 
          complimentary for volunteers.&nbsp; Meals are prepared for you, and shared 
          with the&nbsp;Mission staff.&nbsp; Padre Jorge Nigsch and the nuns go out of 
          their way to welcome you.&nbsp; The success of what they have created here 
          is evident by the fact that many past volunteers continue to return, 
          which we hope to do as well.</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></div>
        <div>
          <font face="Times New Roman">We feel fortunate to have had this 
          opportunity to serve here, as well as share life with the Mission 
          community.&nbsp; It is an excellent opportunity to volunteer for anywhere 
          from 2 weeks to 2 years.&nbsp; We received and learned as much as we gave.</font></div>
