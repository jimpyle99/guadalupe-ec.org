        <p align="right"><span lang="es-ec">September</span> 2002</p>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
        <p>I am writing this letter from the parish clinic in Guadalupe, 
        province Zamora-Chinchipe, Ecuador. The clinic is new and was built and 
        is maintained with donations from other countries. It is a rural clinic 
        that offers much lacking health care to the primarily Shuar and Saraguro 
        Indians that live in the surrounding area. There is a full time 
        registered nurse and part time doctor working here as well as frequent 
        visiting doctors and dentists who donate a few days, weeks or months of 
        their time. We need more medicines to better help the people here. We 
        need especially the following medicines and supplies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Vitamines for children, pregnant women, elderly and anemia<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>600 single dose parasite and ameba treatments<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>500 lice shampoo treatments<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>Antimiotics (Topical, Oral and Vaginal)<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>Antinflammatories, Antacids and Ulcer medications<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>Sensor discs for Bayer Glucometer Style 3952H or visual 
          color-change blood glucose test strips<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>All types of ointment/soap/disinfectant for the skin<br>
          &nbsp; </li>
          <li>A few Corticosteroids (injectable), muscle relaxants, 
          antihistamines, topical antibiotics <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>A couple of Stethoscopes &nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We also hope to offer a much needed parasite medicine program to the 
        500 school children and to the 85 senor citizens in the immediate area. 
        Thus, we need a donation of almost 600 single dose parasite medicine and 
        if possible followed with a single dose ameba treatment, which is a very 
        common condition here. Our other hope is to offer lice shampoo to all of 
        the school children and vitamins to the elderly after their parasite 
        medicine. Any help that you can offer us is very much appreciated.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time in considering this request and for your 
        generosity.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;P. Jorge Nigsch and nurse Amy Anderson</p>
