          <B>We are seeking physicians who will collaborate in our efforts. We 
          extend a cordial invitation to any physician who is in a position to 
          come and work with our people pro bono in exchange for room and board 
          in an inviting, modern and comfortable environment. A visit could be 
          as short as a week or up to several months. This opportunity will 
          provide an individual with the chance to fulfill a social service to 
          humanity. The cultural experience will enrich ones life and will 
          leave a lasting impression as well as a new perspective of life upon 
          returning home.</B></P>
